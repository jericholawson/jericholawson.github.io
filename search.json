This course is not about data analysis—rather, students will learn the R programming language at a deep level. Topics may include data structures, control flow, regular expressions, functions, environments, functional programming, object-oriented programming, debuggging, testing, version control, documentation, literate programming, code review, and package development. The major goal for the course is to contribute to a viable, collaborative, open-source, publishable R package. Prerequisite of SDS 192 and CSC 110/111, or equivalent.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to do the following:\n\nWrite R code that uses various deep-level ideas, such as regex, functions, objects, and documentation.\nContribute to an open-source software project using version control.\nDevelop and debug sophisticated functions in R.\nCreate a robust, encapsulated software package in the R programming language.\n\n\n\n\nTextbooks\n\nWickham, H.

Cumulative numerical averages of 90-100 are guaranteed at least an A-, 80-89 at least a B-, and 70-79 at least a C-. The exact ranges for letter grades will ultimately be determined at the end of the course.\n\n\nClasses and In-Class Exercises (10%)\nEach class will consist of some form of the following: mini-lectures, demos, exercises, quizzes, discussions, and package work time. Expect an experiential environment, where you will be working with code and concepts during the classes. As such, each student must bring their laptop to class.\nStudents are expected to participate during lecture by asking questions and working with other students. In-class activities will be submitted by the end of class through a GitHub repository and are graded for completion and accuracy. To complete these in-class activities, it is required that you show up for class unless extenuating circumstances apply.\nWeekly readings will be assigned to prepare you for content that will be talked about in class. Even though there will be no grade associated with these readings, it is strongly recommended to come to the following week’s classes with these readings completed.\n\n\nProblem Sets (20% total)\nProblem sets will be assigned bi-weekly to provide practice related to the current topics. These problems will involve conceptual exploration of topics, as well as solving through extended problems that tie in multiple topics at once.\nSimilar to the in-class activities, the problem sets will be turned in through a GitHub repository. Questions are graded based on accuracy.\nGrade drop: Your lowest problem set grade will be dropped from your problem set total.\n\n\nExams (30% total)\nTwo exams will be given out in-class to demonstrate your knowledge on the course content. The first exam will be a closed-note written exam, while the second exam will be an open-note, open-laptop exam.\nExpect questions to be similar in vein to the problem sets.\n\n\nPackage (40%)\nThe overall objective of this course is to develop a new R package with a team of your choice. Throughout the second half of the course, you will receive feedback on the functionality, clarity, robustness, and readability of your code and documentation through a series of checkpoints.\nDespite the unique opportunity to create a package in R, it may seem daunting to do so at first. The checkpoints and mini-assignments will pace yourselves as we prepare for the final package. Beneath are the following:\n\nProposal and Help File: due TBD\n\nDevelop a one-page proposal that summarizes the package you want to create and/or modify with appropriate motivations, references, and a course of action.\nCreate a help file on a function that you’ve developed that details what it does, its usage, arguments, values, and examples.\n\nCheckpoint #1: due TBD\n\nDevelop an R package that meets minimum requirements.\n\nCheckpoint #2: due TBD\n\nDevelop an R package that advances on progress from the first checkpoint, including more functions, datasets, and/or descriptions.\n\nRehearsal: given TBD\n\nPrep for demonstration\n\nDemonstration: given in-class on TBD\n\nShowcase and run through a 5-8 minute demonstration on your R package.\n\nWhole package: due TBD\n\nComplete the R package and make any refinements.\n\n\nMore details to come in later weeks.\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPreparation and Attendance\nAs a four-credit course that meets 4.5 hours per week, Smith College expects students to dedicate at least 7.5 hours per week towards the course outside of class. The assignments, readings, and assessments are designed with this target in mind. Expect to read through lecture notes, examples, articles, and forums outside of class along with the assignments.\n\n\nExtensions\n(need to fix)\nYou will be granted 4 late days to use for lab assignments, with a maximum of one day used on each lab assignment. Additionally, you will be granted 4 late days to use for checkpoints during R package development (excluding the demonstration and whole package). No need to inform me that you intend to take these late days. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted without an accommodation from a class dean or from the ARC.\nNote that this policy does not apply to activities, readings, quizzes, or final package/presentation submission.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgment of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Any cases of dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as ChatGPT without permission or instruction to do so.\n\nYou are encouraged to discuss course material, including assignments, with your classmates. All work you turn in, however, must be your own. This includes both writing and code. Copying from other students, from books, or from websites (1) does nothing to help you learn how to program, (2) is easy for us to detect, and (3) has serious negative consequences.\n\n\nGenerative AI\n(need to fix)\nAs mentioned in the Academic Integrity Board, the professor for each course decides whether and how students are allowed to use generative AI in a given course. For this specific course, the use of generative AI to complete assignments or produce content for this course is on a assignment-by-assignment basis.\nAs an upper-division course, you have developed skills to code through basic tasks and processes in data science, as well as to analyze particular behaviors and patterns in the results. Generative AI can be useful as a tool to refine material and gather information about particular parts of code; however, the more you rely on AI, the more you lose out on the ability to think like a data scientist. The human element will be critical in succeeding in data science, and as such, appropriate considerations need to be made when using generative AI on assignments.\nSpecifically, here are the following permissions and constraints regarding generative AI on assignments and tasks in this course:\n\nActivities, exercises, and readings: Generative AI can be used for pre-writing activities and code editing. Use of generative AI for writing any length of written content, composing any length of code, or synthesizing content are prohibited. Code and prose should be written in your own style. Any permitted use of generative AI should be cited in areas in which it was used.\nQuizzes: Generative AI is strictly prohibited on all quizzes.\nPackage: Generative AI for use in development of ideas, pre-writing, and structuring is permitted. However, any formal writing of documentation and code is not permitted.\n\nAny unauthorized use of generative artificial intelligence in this course will be considered a case of academic dishonesty/plagiarism and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Some assignments will also contain modifications to these rules, so be mindful of these rules for each assignment.\n\n\n\nCommunity & Support\n\nCode of Conduct\nAs the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack. This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nPrinciples of Community\nWhether in a class, college, or neighborhood setting, achieving a warm community is essential to your well-being. In this class, I hope we can foster a collaborative and welcoming environment: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities.\nTo establish this, consider the following:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge what we do and don’t know, as well as how our colleagues experience the world.\nSupport colleagues that may be stepping outside of their comfort zone (i.e. presentations).\nAsk questions often in our Slack workspace. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nAdmit mistakes. They happen, and I will certainly make mistakes in class.\nUse pronouns. This provides a foundation to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a sense of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\nAccommodations\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact the Accessibility Resource Center in College Hall 104 or at arc@smith.edu. The Center will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ARC, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nStudent Well-Being\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center.\nAdditional resources and support offered by the college are listed below:\n\nAccessibility Resource Center (ARC)\nSpinelli Center: Support for students doing quantitative work. Includes tutoring and resources.\n\nFor this class: Sun-Thurs, 7-9pm in Sabin-Reed 301.\nEmail qlctutor@smith.edu for specific request for help.\n\nCrisis Resources\nCounseling Services\nWellness Resources\nGender Identity and Expression\nDiscriminatory Harassment\n\n\n\n\nCourse Outline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nDates\nTopics\nCh.\nAssignments / Notes\n\n\n\n\n1\n1/26-30\nIntroduction (R, GitHub), Data Structures\nAR3\n\n\n\n2\n2/2-6\nLists, Data Frames, Assignment\nAR2, 4\n\n\n\n3\n2/9-13\nControl Flow, Functions\nAR5, 6\n\n\n\n4\n2/16-20\nFunctions, Iteration\nAR5, 6, 9\n\n\n\n5\n2/23-2/27\nFunctionals, Review\nAR9\nExam #1: Wed. 2/25\n\n\n6\n3/2-3/6\nEnvironments, Packages\nAR7, RP1-3\n\n\n\n7\n3/9-13\nConditions, OOP\nAR8, 12\n\n\n\n8\n3/16-20\nSpring Break!\n\nNo class: Mon. 3/16; Wed. 3/20\n\n\n9\n3/23-27\nS3, Package Foundation\nAR12, RP3 \nHelp file due Tues, 10/21\n\n\n10\n3/30-4/3\nDescription, usethis\nRP9-12\nExam #2: Mon. 3/30\n\n\n11\n4/6-10\nCode, Data, Manuals, Testing\nRP6, 7, 16\n\n\n\n12\n4/13-17\nTesting, Vignettes\nRP13, 17\n\n\n\n13\n4/20-24\nProject Time\n\nCheckpoint #1 due Thurs, 11/20\n\n\n14\n4/27-5/1\nProject Time, Demonstrations\nNA\n\n\n\nFinals\n5/2-9\nFinals\nNA\nPackage due Tues. 5/10\n\n\n\n\nNote that the assignments and topics covered are tentatively scheduled and may be altered slightly as the quarter progresses.

Cumulative numerical averages of 90-100 are guaranteed at least an A-, 80-89 at least a B-, and 70-79 at least a C-. The exact ranges for letter grades will ultimately be determined at the end of the course.\n\n\nMW Classes, Readings, Activties, and Exercises (10%)\nPrior to the upcoming week, readings will be assigned through Perusall that prepare you for material that will be explored thereafter. The readings on Perusall will involve:\n\nReading through the material\nWriting 2-4 annotations\nHighlighting one item you learned and one item that seems challenging\n\nThese annotations will allow me to identify which concepts to focus on in more detail during the week. Generally, these items will be due on Sundays at 11:59pm, with no acceptance of late work. Readings will be graded on completion.\nDuring Mondays and Wednesday classes, we will go through mini-lectures, activities, and demos. Classes will be experiential, meaning that you will have the opportunity to apply concepts from class to activities, exercises, and investigations. Students are expected to participate during lecture by asking questions and working with other students. Additionally, it is required that you bring your laptop to class. Class activities will be administered often during lecture, and you will have until the end of lecture to turn them in through your GitHub submission repository. These activities will be graded based on completion and/or correctness.\nOn occasion, a reading exercise may be assigned on Wednesday for you to complete. Similar to the activities, these will be turned in through your GitHub submission repository by Thursdays at 11:59pm. These exercises will be graded based on completion and correctness.\n\n\nFriday Classes and Labs (30%)\nFriday’s classes are dedicated exclusively to labs unless otherwise stated. In these labs, you will have the opportunity to compile (no pun intended) what you’ve learned and work on a experiential assignment that showcases those skills. This will involve strong usage of R and GitHub. In earlier weeks, we will get you all familiar with the technical programs along with the workflow.\nLabs in this course introduce a data science skill by walking you through exploratory analysis of a dataset documenting a socially-relevant issue (such as racial profiling in policing, affordable housing, and pollution). Labs will be started in class on Fridays and completed for homework by Wednesdays at 11:59pm. If you finish a lab early, you are encouraged to help your classmates. Labs will be graded on both completion and correctness. Note that at the end of each lab, there will be a prompt asking you to consider some of the ethical considerations of the data analysis you just completed. You must respond to this prompt in Slack to earn full credit on the lab.\nAll lab assignments will be submitted through your GitHub submission repository. You will submit assignments by pushing changes to template documents to a private GitHub repository. I will provide guidance on how to do this early in the semester.\n\n\nProjects (30% total)\nTwo projects will be assigned throughout the semester. The projects are designed to test your ability to successfully complete course objectives as described earlier. The following two projects, along with their tentative due dates, are seen below:\n\nProject #1: Data Visualizations and GitHub: due Wednesday, 3/4 at 11:59pm\n\nCreate meaningful, informative, and clear visualizations that communicate information from the data and real-world issue.\nConfigure an appropriate pipeline that funnels all relevant information, files, and summaries into a GitHub repository.\n\nProject #2: Workflow and Real-World Investigation: due Monday, 4/27 at 11:59pm\n\nComplete a detailed, attentive workflow of an investigation related to a real-world issue with appropriate data and context.\nPresent relevant information and code to various audiences in multiple formats, including a report, presentation, and demonstration.\n\n\nMore details to come in later weeks.\n\n\nExams (30% total)\nTwo exams will be administered during the course of the semester, which will include written and oral parts. The first exam will be administered in-class on Friday, 3/13, while the second exam will be administered during finals week as a self-scheduled exam. More details to come in later weeks."

    "title": "Syllabus",
    "section": "Policies",
    "text": "Policies\n\nPreparation and Attendance\nAs a four-credit course that meets 4.5 hours per week, Smith expects students to dedicate at least 7.5 hours per week towards the course outside of class. The assignments, readings, and assessments are designed with this target in mind. Expect to read through lecture notes, examples, articles, and forums outside of class along with the assignments.\nAttending class is imperative to your learning and taking part in an active community. Attendance will be taken for each class period. However, things come up and you may not have the capacity to attend. As such, you will be able to miss 3 classes with no penalty. After the third unexcused absence, your overall grade will drop by 1% for each class missed. Additional absences may be excused due to family/personal difficulties, sickness, or school or career-related activities; however, I will require some form of documentation for these absences. Please speak with your class dean or the Accessibility Resource Center so that we can get documentation of your need.\nDo make every effort to arrive to class on time. If you happen/plan to arrive more than 10 minutes late, please inform me ahead of time. Any unexplained tardiness will result in a marked absence. If you must miss a class entirely, you should contact a peer to discuss what was missed.\n\n\nExtensions\nYou will be granted 2 free late days to use for lab assignments, with a maximum of one day used on each lab assignment. Additionally, you will be granted 2 late days to use for final project submissions, with a maximum of two days used at a single time. No need to inform me that you intend to take these late days. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted without an accommodation from a class dean or from the ARC.\nNote that this policy does not apply to Perusall annotations, reading exercises, exams, or project checkpoints/proposals/presentations.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\nAs a student at Smith College, the college expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in preparation and submission of all course work and examinations, as outlined by the Academic Integrity Board (AIB). The AIB provides an Academic Integrity Statement, which all students are expected to abide by. Any cases of academic dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of these behaviors include:\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as ChatGPT without permission or instruction to do so.\n\nYou are encouraged to discuss course material, including assignments, with your classmates. All work you turn in, however, must be your own. This includes both writing and code. Copying from other students, from books, or from websites (1) does nothing to help you learn how to program, (2) is easy for us to detect, and (3) has serious negative consequences.\n\n\nGenerative AI\nAs mentioned in the Academic Integrity Board, the professor for each course decides whether and how students are allowed to use generative AI in a given course. For this specific course, any use of generative AI to complete assignments or produce content for this course is prohibited, unless otherwise stated in the assignment itself.\nAs a foundational course, it is critical that you are able to think like a data scientist, which includes producing meaningful code, developing logical solutions to problem, and critiquing good results from the bad ones. While the use of generative AI can be beneficial at producing base-level code and providing insights, it comes at the detriment of your own critical thinking. The human element will be critical in succeeding in data science. If you don’t develop the skills to understand how the underlying code is composed/works, then you will not be prepared for this kind of work.\nProhibited forms of generative AI usage include but are not limited to:\n\nSummarizing course readings.\nDrafting, editing, and proofreading responses to written prompts on any assignment.\nComposing and/or formatting code and comments.\nAnswering lab, quiz, or exam questions.\nConducting analysis of any plots, methods, and results for any assignment.\n\nAny unauthorized use of generative artificial intelligence in this course will be considered a case of academic dishonesty/plagiarism and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.\nCaveat: While the policy here is strict, do note that there will be assignments and lectures that go through the ethical and effective use of generative AI in data science as part of a unit. In these assignments, further directions will be given to showcase the use of generative AI. However, unless otherwise stated, generative AI should not be used in any assignment."

    "text": "Community & Support\n\nCode of Conduct\nAs the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack. This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nPrinciples of Community\nWhether in a class, college, or neighborhood setting, achieving a warm community is essential to your well-being. In this class, I hope we can foster a collaborative and welcoming environment: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities.\nTo establish this, consider the following:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge what we do and don’t know, as well as how our colleagues experience the world.\nSupport colleagues that may be stepping outside of their comfort zone (i.e. presentations).\nAsk questions often in our Slack workspace. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nAdmit mistakes. They happen, and I will certainly make mistakes in class.\nUse pronouns. This provides a foundation to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a sense of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\nAccommodations\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact the Accessibility Resource Center in College Hall 104 or at arc@smith.edu. The Center will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ARC, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nStudent Well-Being\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center.\nAdditional resources and support offered by the college are listed below:\n\nAccessibility Resource Center (ARC)\nSpinelli Center: Support for students doing quantitative work. Includes tutoring and resources.\n\nFor this class: Sun-Thurs, 7-9pm in Sabin-Reed 301.\nEmail qlctutor@smith.edu for specific request for help.\n\nCrisis Resources\nCounseling Services\nWellness Resources\nGender Identity and Expression\nDiscriminatory Harassment"

    "text": "Getting Familiar with R and RStudio\nAs discussed in the Tech Setup assignment, R is the coding language we will be using to generate plots, data wrangle, and accomplish other data science tasks. The interface we will use is RStudio.\nFor each and every lab, we will be using the lab repository you created when completing the Tech Setup assignment. On the SDS 192 website, you will find the following for each lab:\n\nLab instructions (via web)\nLab template (via .qmd)\n\nDownload the .qmd file and place that file into your lab repository. From there, open RStudio, open the lab repository project by going to File &gt; Recent Projects &gt; lab-repo. Then, open this template file up in RStudio by going to File &gt; Open File and locating the file in your repository.\nYou will see the file open up in the top-left corner of the RStudio window. You will edit the code in this file particularly.\nLet’s talk about each of the four sections you’re seeing in the RStudio window. Approximately, you will see the following:\n\n\nTop-left: This will show any files you are working on. You will use this section primarily to add code and prose to the lab templates. The templates are .qmd files, meaning you will see gray chunks that contain R code and white space that contains prose. R code should only go in gray chunks, while any written text should be in whitespace. We’ll expand upon this in later labs. Some things to note:\n\nTo create new gray chunks: Ctrl + Opt + I on keyboard\nTo run whole chunks: Hit the green “Play” button at the top-right corner of the gray chunk\nAll copy/paste and save commands are similar to what’d you see in something like Word.\n\nBottom-left: This area houses the console and terminal. I tend to use the console for single-line commands to test out code. We will not use this area too much.\nTop-right: This area houses various features, including our Environment and Git. The environment shows you which items are stored on your computer when using R and RStudio. The Git tab will be where you update items in your repository, which was mentioned in the Tech Setup assignment.\nBottom-left: This area house other features, most importantly the Files, Plots, and Help tabs. I encourage you to play around with these tabs to see their functionality. In the image above, I have it set to the Help tab; this is useful when trying to learn certain functionality of commands in R, such as the min() function.\n\nIt’s a lot to comprehend initially, so take it in stride as you work through lecture activities and lab assignments."

This data was first published in 2015 and since has undergone several improvements and revisions.\nThe College Scorecard dataset is massive. It includes information about over 6500 institutions in the U.S., and has more than 3000 columns documenting information about those institutions. I chose this dataset for this lab because, if you can learn to read this data dictionary, you will be leaps and bounds ahead of the game in learning to read other data dictionaries. (It’s also just a super cool dataset, and hint, hint: you will get a chance to dive into it in much more detail in a few weeks). While the full data is available online, we are only going to work with a small subset of the data today."

    "section": "Getting to Know the Dataset",
    "text": "Getting to Know the Dataset\n\nObservations (Rows)\nIn starting our data analysis, we need to have a good sense of what each observation in our dataset refers to - or its observational unit. Think of it this way. If you were to count the number rows in your dataset, what would that number refer to? A unique key is a variable (or set of variables) that uniquely identifies an observation in the dataset. Think of a unique key as a unique way to identify a row and all of the values in it. There should never be more than one row in the dataset with the same unique key. A unique key tells us what each row in the dataset refers to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion 1 (5 pts)\n\n\n\nSee if you can identify a unique key for this dataset. Write some lines of code to determine whether the column you’ve identified can act as unique key for the data. Hint: You need to check whether the values in the column ever repeat.\n\n# Write code to calculate number of rows in scorecard\n\n# Write code to calculate the number of unique values in the column you've identified as a unique key \n\n# Do these numbers match?\n\n\n\nAnytime we count something in the world, we are not only engaging in a process of tabulation; we are also engaging in a process of defining. If I count the number of students in a class, I first have to define what counts as a student. If someone is auditing the class, do they count? If I, as the instructor, am learning from my students, do I count myself as a student? As I make decisions about how I’m going to define “student,” those decisions impact the numbers that I produce. When I change my definition of “student,” how I go about tabulating students also changes. Thus, as we prepare to count observations in a dataset, it is important to know how those observations are defined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion 2 (5 pts)\n\n\n\nAt this point, you’ve probably figured out that each row in this dataset is a higher education institution. However, there are many different ways that we can define higher education institutions, and that will impact what gets included and excluded in our data. Referencing the Technical Documentation, locate a definition for the unit of observation in this dataset. What institutions are included, and what institutions are excluded? Summarize a definition below.\n\n\n\n\nVariables (Columns)\nNote the column names for this dataframe, and the kinds of values that appear in those columns. Some of them (like city and year) might make sense to you immediately. Others (like pcip27 and highdeg) might be much more confusing. To figure out what we are looking at, we are going to need to refer to the dataset’s data dictionary.\nOpen the data dictionary you downloaded in an earlier step. It will open as an Excel file. Click on the tab labeled “Institution_Data_Dictionary”. There are thousands of variables in this dataset, falling into the broader categories of school, completion, admissions, cost, etc. Note how the file is organized, and specifically draw your attention to:\n\nColumn 1 (NAME OF DATA ELEMENT): This is a long description of the variable and gives you clues as to what is represented in it.\nColumn 6 (VARIABLE NAME): This is the column name for the variable. This is how you will reference the variable in R.\nColumn 7 (VALUE): These are the possible values for that variable. Note that for many categorical variables, the values are numbers. We are going to have to associate the numbers with their corresponding labels.\nColumn 8 (LABEL): These are the labels associated with the values recorded for the variable.\nColumn 11 (NOTES): This provides notes about the variable, including whether it is currently in use and what missing values indicate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion 3 (5 pts)\n\n\n\nFor each of the variable names in the scorecard data frame, look up the associated name in the data dictionary. You will need to search for the variable name in the sixth column of the data dictionary (I recommend using Ctrl-F to quickly locate the variable name in the spreadsheet.) Once you’ve found the variable name, reference column 1 to determine what this variable means, and reference columns 7 and 8 to see what possible values will appear in that column.\nIdentify one nominal variable, one ordinal variable, one discrete variable, and one continuous variable in scorecard and list their variable names below. Then uncomment the lines below and use the typeof() function to see how R determined their data types. Did any surprise you?\n\n#typeof(scorecard$_____)\n#typeof(scorecard$_____)\n#typeof(scorecard$_____)\n#typeof(scorecard$_____)\n\n\n\n\n\nValues (Cells)\nYou may have noticed that several categorical variables are coded as numbers in the imported dataset. For instance, look at the column control which designates the institution’s ownership. Running the code below, we see that the distinct values in that column are 1, 2, and 3.\n\nunique(scorecard$control)\n\n[1] 2 1 3\n\n\nWhen we reference that column in the data dictionary (row 27), we see that a 1 in that column designates that the institution is Public, a 2 that the institution is Private nonprofit, and a 3 that the institution is Private for-profit. While I can always look that up, sometimes it is helpful to have that information in our dataset. For instance, let’s say I create a bar plot that’s supposed to show how many higher education institutions have each type of ownership in MA (which you will learn how to do soon!). The plot can be confusing when control is a series of numbers.\n\nggplot(scorecard, aes(x = control)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this in mind, sometimes it can be helpful to recode the values in a column. Recoding data involves replacing the values in a vector according to criteria that we provide. Remember how all columns in a data frame are technically vectors? We can use the recode() function to recode all of the values in the control vector. We are going to store the recoded values in a new column in our dataset called control_text. Check out the code below to see how we do this. Reference the help pages for recode (i.e. ?recode) to help you interpret the code.\n\nscorecard$control_text &lt;-\n  recode(\n    scorecard$control, \n    \"1\" = \"Public\", \n    \"2\" = \"Private nonprofit\", \n    \"3\" = \"Private for-profit\",\n    .default = NA_character_\n  )\n\nCheck out our barplot now!\n\nggplot(scorecard, aes(x = control_text)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion 4 (5 pts)\n\n\n\nWrite code below to recode the admcon7 variable and store the results in a new variable in scorecard called admcon7_text. You’ll need to look up the values in the data dictionary. If you’ve done this correctly, running this code should produce a barplot that displays multiple bars.\n\nscorecard$admcon7_text &lt;-\n  recode(\n    scorecard$admcon7, \n    #Fill replacements here\n    .default = NA_character_\n  )\n\nggplot(scorecard, aes(x = admcon7_text)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing Values\nWhen we have missing values in a rectangular dataset, we have to provide a placeholder for the missing value in order for the dataset to remain rectangular. If we just skipped the value, then our dataset wouldn’t necessarily have rows of all equal lengths and columns of all equal lengths. In R, NA serves as that placeholder. Before we start analyzing data, it can be important to note how many NA values we have in a column so that we can determine if the data is representative.\nThe function is.na() checks whether a value is an NA value and returns TRUE if it is and FALSE if it isn’t. Providing a vector to is.na() will check this for every value in the vector and return a logical vector indicating TRUE/FALSE for every original value in the vector.\n\nis.na(scorecard$wdraw_orig_yr2_rt)\n\n  [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n [16] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n [31] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n [46] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n [61] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n [76] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n [91] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n[106] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n[121] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n[136] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n\n\nWhen we sum() across a logical vector, R will calculate the number of TRUE values in the vector.\n\nsum(is.na(scorecard$wdraw_orig_yr2_rt))\n\n[1] 147\n\n# Note that this is the same as:\n\nscorecard$wdraw_orig_yr2_rt |&gt; is.na() |&gt; sum()\n\n[1] 147\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion 5 (5 pts)\n\n\n\nIn a code chunk below, calculate the number of missing values in both the costt4_a and the costt4_p columns. Reference the NOTES column in the data dictionary to determine why there are so many NA values in these columns. Add a comment to the code chunk below, explaining the reason for missing values in these columns.\n\n# Write code here\n\n# Add comment here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQuestion 6 (5 pts)\n\n\n\nReferencing the College Scorecard data documentation, see if you can determine which students are included in calculations of earnings and debt. How might the data’s coverage bias the values that get reported? What might be the social consequences of these biases? Share your ideas on our discussions Slack channel."

    "text": "R and RStudio\nR and RStudio will collectively make up the coding tools we will use to run through data science examples and assignments. R is the coding language that many statisticians and data scientists use to generate data visualizations, complete data wrangling, and run analyses. RStudio is the application that we use to interact with R, formally known as an IDE (i.e. Integrated Development Environment). We will use RStudio particularly when writing R code and walking through problems.\nWe will need to download and install R and RStudio onto our laptops. If you are running a web-based operating system (e.g. ChromeOS), you will have to use Posit Cloud to run R. Instructions to use Posit Cloud can be seen at the bottom of this section.\nFor everyone else (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux), you will download and install R and RStudio using these instructions:\n\nGo to the following link here.\nInstall R first by clicking on “Download and Install R”, which can be found on the left side of the page.\nYou will be redirected to https://cran.rstudio.com/.\n\nWindows: Click on the link to “Download R for Windows”, choose “install R for the first time”, then choose “Download R 4.5.2 for Windows”.\nMacOS: Click “Download R for (Mac) OS X”. Download the install package for version R-4.5.2. Read the information carefully to determine which of the two versions to download.\nLinux: Click on the link to “Download R for Linux”. You will need to choose the version of Linux that corresponds to your installation. Versions are available for Debian, RedHat, SUSE, and Ubuntu.\n\nOnce the R file has been downloaded, please install R by opening the file. Follow all prompts as necessary, keeping things as defaulted as possible.\nGo back to the Posit webpage and follow step 2 on the page by clicking “Download RStudio Desktop for ____”. Once downloaded, install RStudio by opening the file. Follow all prompts as necessary.\n\nFor those using Posit Cloud:\n\nClick the Login button located at the top-right corner of the screen.\nSign-in using either Google or GitHub.\n\nIf you have trouble installing and downloading R/RStudio, we will have some time at the beginning of the first lab to walk through any issues you all have."

    "text": "git, GitHub, and GitHub Classroom\nWe will be using git commands, GitHub, and GitHub classroom to collaborate with others on coding and projects, submit coding-relative activities and assignments, and get familiar with data science workflows.\nTo differentiate between the terms, when referring to “git”, this refers to the software and commands associated with tracking changes in files during software development. The actions “push”, “pull”, “commit”, and others will pop up and we will discuss these in detail throughout the semester. GitHub refers to the application that utilizes the git system to aid in these processes. GitHub Classroom is a special use of GitHub that will allow for specific repositories to be linked to our classroom.\nA few actions need to happen to set these items up, which you’ll see in the subsections below.\n\nSetting Up Your R Environment\nIf you have any troubles, you can use the Happy Git with R textbook for assistance.\n\nGo to GitHub and create a GitHub account, preferably with your smith.edu account. Setup account details.\nOpen RStudio on your laptop.\nCheck to ensure you have git installed by opening RStudio and clicking on Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Git/SVN tab. Check the top of the pane for a field for the Git executable. It should say something like: “/usr/bin/git” or “C:/Program Files/Git/”. If it says “(Not Found)” git is not installed.\nIn the R console (bottom-left corner), you will input and hit Enter for each of these lines of code (replace what it is in the quotations with your info):\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\nlibrary(usethis)\nuse_git_config(user.name = \"PUT GITHUB USERNAME HERE\", user.email = \"PUT GITHUB EMAIL HERE\")\n\n\nPut the following line of code in the console:\n\n\ncreate_github_token()\n\nDefine a name for the token and set the expiration date to be 150 days from today’s date. Leave all other settings the same and generate the token.\nOnce done, please save the token in some fashion. You will not see this token again once you leave the webpage.\n\nReturn to RStudio and run the following lines of code in the console:\n\n\nlibrary(gitcreds)\ngitcreds_set()\n\nWhen prompted for the token, paste the token you created into the console and hit Enter.\nIf you are needing additional assistance, please use the following videos:\n\nConfiguring git\nPersonal Access Token (PAT)\nStoring PAT\n\n\n\nSetting Up GitHub Classroom and Future Repositories\nYour current and future RStudio environments are now linked to your GitHub account, providing you access to repositories on GitHub itself. With this in mind, we can now replicate repositories from GitHub in a process called cloning.\n\nUse the following link below to access the test repository from GitHub Classroom:\n\nhttps://classroom.github.com/a/_arMNRWC\n\n\nYou will go through all necessary prompts. Feel free to use this video as a resource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsQ48kn-uD0\n\nCopy the URL for your SDS 192 Lab GitHub repo. It should look like the following link:\n\nhttps://github.com/sds192lawson/tech-setup-repository-YOUR_USERNAME\n\nGo back to RStudio. At the top-left corner, click on File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; git.\n\nPaste the URL into the first field, type a simple name for the folder in the second field, and choose an appropriate directory on your computer to house the repository. Then, click Create Project.\n\nInstall the rmarkdown package in RStudio by entering the following lines of code in the console.\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\n\n\nOn the initial install, the Files tab will be in the lower right hand corner of RStudio. Open practice.qmd, and then follow the prompts in that file. Click Save.\nWe will now pull, commit, and push changes to the remote repository on GitHub. To do so, go to the Git tab on the top-right corner. From there,\n\nClick on the blue downward arrow, which pulls updates from the remote repository. This ensures we have the most recent updates.\nClick on the stacked checkmark in the same area, which will allow you to commit changes to the remote repository. Stage each file in the left column by clicking on the checkbox and add a message in the right column that briefly specifies what changes you’ve made to the repository. Click Commit thereafter.\nClick on the green upward area, which pushes updates to the remote repository. A window will pop up, showing the status of the push. If successful, you should see those updated files in your GitHub repository. You can use the URL from step 8 to verify.\n\nRepeat steps 7-9 twice, each for the following two repositories you will use for lecture activities and lab assignments respectively:\n\nActivities Repo: https://classroom.github.com/a/V5LWa0K6\nLab Repo: https://classroom.github.com/a/vO0Mut-V\n\n\nIf you are needing additional assistance, please use the following videos:\n\nConfiguring RStudio Projects\nCommitting Files\nPushing Files"
