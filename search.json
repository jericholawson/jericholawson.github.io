This course is not about data analysis—rather, students will learn the R programming language at a deep level. Topics may include data structures, control flow, regular expressions, functions, environments, functional programming, object-oriented programming, debuggging, testing, version control, documentation, literate programming, code review, and package development. The major goal for the course is to contribute to a viable, collaborative, open-source, publishable R package. Prerequisite of SDS 192 and CSC 110/111, or equivalent.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to do the following:\n\nWrite R code that uses various deep-level ideas, such as regex, functions, objects, and documentation.\nContribute to an open-source software project using version control.\nDevelop and debug sophisticated functions in R.\nCreate a robust, encapsulated software package in the R programming language.\n\n\n\n\nTextbooks\n\nWickham, H.

Cumulative numerical averages of 90-100 are guaranteed at least an A-, 80-89 at least a B-, and 70-79 at least a C-. The exact ranges for letter grades will ultimately be determined at the end of the course.\n\n\nClasses and In-Class Exercises (10%)\nEach class will consist of some form of the following: mini-lectures, demos, exercises, quizzes, discussions, and package work time. Expect an experiential environment, where you will be working with code and concepts during the classes. As such, each student must bring their laptop to class.\nStudents are expected to participate during lecture by asking questions and working with other students. In-class activities will be submitted by the end of class through a GitHub repository and are graded for completion and accuracy. To complete these in-class activities, it is required that you show up for class unless extenuating circumstances apply.\nWeekly readings will be assigned to prepare you for content that will be talked about in class. Even though there will be no grade associated with these readings, it is strongly recommended to come to the following week’s classes with these readings completed.\n\n\nProblem Sets (20% total)\nProblem sets will be assigned bi-weekly to provide practice related to the current topics. These problems will involve conceptual exploration of topics, as well as solving through extended problems that tie in multiple topics at once.\nSimilar to the in-class activities, the problem sets will be turned in through a GitHub repository. Questions are graded based on accuracy.\nGrade drop: Your lowest problem set grade will be dropped from your problem set total.\n\n\nExams (30% total)\nTwo exams will be given out in-class to demonstrate your knowledge on the course content. The first exam will be a closed-note written exam, while the second exam will be an open-note, open-laptop exam.\nExpect questions to be similar in vein to the problem sets.\n\n\nPackage (40%)\nThe overall objective of this course is to develop a new R package with a team of your choice. Throughout the second half of the course, you will receive feedback on the functionality, clarity, robustness, and readability of your code and documentation through a series of checkpoints.\nDespite the unique opportunity to create a package in R, it may seem daunting to do so at first. The checkpoints and mini-assignments will pace yourselves as we prepare for the final package. Beneath are the following:\n\nProposal and Help File: due TBD\n\nDevelop a one-page proposal that summarizes the package you want to create and/or modify with appropriate motivations, references, and a course of action.\nCreate a help file on a function that you’ve developed that details what it does, its usage, arguments, values, and examples.\n\nCheckpoint #1: due TBD\n\nDevelop an R package that meets minimum requirements.\n\nCheckpoint #2: due TBD\n\nDevelop an R package that advances on progress from the first checkpoint, including more functions, datasets, and/or descriptions.\n\nRehearsal: given TBD\n\nPrep for demonstration\n\nDemonstration: given in-class on TBD\n\nShowcase and run through a 5-8 minute demonstration on your R package.\n\nWhole package: due TBD\n\nComplete the R package and make any refinements.\n\n\nMore details to come in later weeks.\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nPreparation and Attendance\nAs a four-credit course that meets 4.5 hours per week, Smith College expects students to dedicate at least 7.5 hours per week towards the course outside of class. The assignments, readings, and assessments are designed with this target in mind. Expect to read through lecture notes, examples, articles, and forums outside of class along with the assignments.\n\n\nExtensions\n(need to fix)\nYou will be granted 4 late days to use for lab assignments, with a maximum of one day used on each lab assignment. Additionally, you will be granted 4 late days to use for checkpoints during R package development (excluding the demonstration and whole package). No need to inform me that you intend to take these late days. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted without an accommodation from a class dean or from the ARC.\nNote that this policy does not apply to activities, readings, quizzes, or final package/presentation submission.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgment of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Any cases of dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as ChatGPT without permission or instruction to do so.\n\nYou are encouraged to discuss course material, including assignments, with your classmates. All work you turn in, however, must be your own. This includes both writing and code. Copying from other students, from books, or from websites (1) does nothing to help you learn how to program, (2) is easy for us to detect, and (3) has serious negative consequences.\n\n\nGenerative AI\n(need to fix)\nAs mentioned in the Academic Integrity Board, the professor for each course decides whether and how students are allowed to use generative AI in a given course. For this specific course, the use of generative AI to complete assignments or produce content for this course is on a assignment-by-assignment basis.\nAs an upper-division course, you have developed skills to code through basic tasks and processes in data science, as well as to analyze particular behaviors and patterns in the results. Generative AI can be useful as a tool to refine material and gather information about particular parts of code; however, the more you rely on AI, the more you lose out on the ability to think like a data scientist. The human element will be critical in succeeding in data science, and as such, appropriate considerations need to be made when using generative AI on assignments.\nSpecifically, here are the following permissions and constraints regarding generative AI on assignments and tasks in this course:\n\nActivities, exercises, and readings: Generative AI can be used for pre-writing activities and code editing. Use of generative AI for writing any length of written content, composing any length of code, or synthesizing content are prohibited. Code and prose should be written in your own style. Any permitted use of generative AI should be cited in areas in which it was used.\nQuizzes: Generative AI is strictly prohibited on all quizzes.\nPackage: Generative AI for use in development of ideas, pre-writing, and structuring is permitted. However, any formal writing of documentation and code is not permitted.\n\nAny unauthorized use of generative artificial intelligence in this course will be considered a case of academic dishonesty/plagiarism and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Some assignments will also contain modifications to these rules, so be mindful of these rules for each assignment.\n\n\n\nCommunity & Support\n\nCode of Conduct\nAs the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack. This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nPrinciples of Community\nWhether in a class, college, or neighborhood setting, achieving a warm community is essential to your well-being. In this class, I hope we can foster a collaborative and welcoming environment: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities.\nTo establish this, consider the following:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge what we do and don’t know, as well as how our colleagues experience the world.\nSupport colleagues that may be stepping outside of their comfort zone (i.e. presentations).\nAsk questions often in our Slack workspace. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nAdmit mistakes. They happen, and I will certainly make mistakes in class.\nUse pronouns. This provides a foundation to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a sense of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\nAccommodations\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact the Accessibility Resource Center in College Hall 104 or at arc@smith.edu. The Center will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ARC, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nStudent Well-Being\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center.\nAdditional resources and support offered by the college are listed below:\n\nAccessibility Resource Center (ARC)\nSpinelli Center: Support for students doing quantitative work. Includes tutoring and resources.\n\nFor this class: Sun-Thurs, 7-9pm in Sabin-Reed 301.\nEmail qlctutor@smith.edu for specific request for help.\n\nCrisis Resources\nCounseling Services\nWellness Resources\nGender Identity and Expression\nDiscriminatory Harassment\n\n\n\n\nCourse Outline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nDates\nTopics\nCh.\nAssignments / Notes\n\n\n\n\n1\n1/26-30\nIntroduction (R, GitHub), Data Structures\nAR3\n\n\n\n2\n2/2-6\nLists, Data Frames, Assignment\nAR2, 4\n\n\n\n3\n2/9-13\nControl Flow, Functions\nAR5, 6\n\n\n\n4\n2/16-20\nFunctions, Iteration\nAR5, 6, 9\n\n\n\n5\n2/23-2/27\nFunctionals, Review\nAR9\nExam #1: Wed. 2/25\n\n\n6\n3/2-3/6\nEnvironments, Packages\nAR7, RP1-3\n\n\n\n7\n3/9-13\nConditions, OOP\nAR8, 12\n\n\n\n8\n3/16-20\nSpring Break!\n\nNo class: Mon. 3/16; Wed. 3/20\n\n\n9\n3/23-27\nS3, Package Foundation\nAR12, RP3 \nHelp file due Tues, 10/21\n\n\n10\n3/30-4/3\nDescription, usethis\nRP9-12\nExam #2: Mon. 3/30\n\n\n11\n4/6-10\nCode, Data, Manuals, Testing\nRP6, 7, 16\n\n\n\n12\n4/13-17\nTesting, Vignettes\nRP13, 17\n\n\n\n13\n4/20-24\nProject Time\n\nCheckpoint #1 due Thurs, 11/20\n\n\n14\n4/27-5/1\nProject Time, Demonstrations\nNA\n\n\n\nFinals\n5/2-9\nFinals\nNA\nPackage due Tues. 5/10\n\n\n\n\nNote that the assignments and topics covered are tentatively scheduled and may be altered slightly as the quarter progresses.

Cumulative numerical averages of 90-100 are guaranteed at least an A-, 80-89 at least a B-, and 70-79 at least a C-. The exact ranges for letter grades will ultimately be determined at the end of the course.\n\n\nMW Classes, Readings, Activties, and Exercises (10%)\nPrior to the upcoming week, readings will be assigned through Perusall that prepare you for material that will be explored thereafter. The readings on Perusall will involve:\n\nReading through the material\nWriting 2-4 annotations\nHighlighting one item you learned and one item that seems challenging\n\nThese annotations will allow me to identify which concepts to focus on in more detail during the week. Generally, these items will be due on Sundays at 11:59pm, with no acceptance of late work. Readings will be graded on completion.\nDuring Mondays and Wednesday classes, we will go through mini-lectures, activities, and demos. Classes will be experiential, meaning that you will have the opportunity to apply concepts from class to activities, exercises, and investigations. Students are expected to participate during lecture by asking questions and working with other students. Additionally, it is required that you bring your laptop to class. Class activities will be administered often during lecture, and you will have until the end of lecture to turn them in through your GitHub submission repository. These activities will be graded based on completion and/or correctness.\nOn occasion, a reading exercise may be assigned on Wednesday for you to complete. Similar to the activities, these will be turned in through your GitHub submission repository by Thursdays at 11:59pm. These exercises will be graded based on completion and correctness.\n\n\nFriday Classes and Labs (30%)\nFriday’s classes are dedicated exclusively to labs unless otherwise stated. In these labs, you will have the opportunity to compile (no pun intended) what you’ve learned and work on a experiential assignment that showcases those skills. This will involve strong usage of R and GitHub. In earlier weeks, we will get you all familiar with the technical programs along with the workflow.\nLabs in this course introduce a data science skill by walking you through exploratory analysis of a dataset documenting a socially-relevant issue (such as racial profiling in policing, affordable housing, and pollution). Labs will be started in class on Fridays and completed for homework by Wednesdays at 11:59pm. If you finish a lab early, you are encouraged to help your classmates. Labs will be graded on both completion and correctness. Note that at the end of each lab, there will be a prompt asking you to consider some of the ethical considerations of the data analysis you just completed. You must respond to this prompt in Slack to earn full credit on the lab.\nAll lab assignments will be submitted through your GitHub submission repository. You will submit assignments by pushing changes to template documents to a private GitHub repository. I will provide guidance on how to do this early in the semester.\n\n\nProjects (30% total)\nTwo projects will be assigned throughout the semester. The projects are designed to test your ability to successfully complete course objectives as described earlier. The following two projects, along with their tentative due dates, are seen below:\n\nProject #1: Data Visualizations and GitHub: due Wednesday, 3/4 at 11:59pm\n\nCreate meaningful, informative, and clear visualizations that communicate information from the data and real-world issue.\nConfigure an appropriate pipeline that funnels all relevant information, files, and summaries into a GitHub repository.\n\nProject #2: Workflow and Real-World Investigation: due Monday, 4/27 at 11:59pm\n\nComplete a detailed, attentive workflow of an investigation related to a real-world issue with appropriate data and context.\nPresent relevant information and code to various audiences in multiple formats, including a report, presentation, and demonstration.\n\n\nMore details to come in later weeks.\n\n\nExams (30% total)\nTwo exams will be administered during the course of the semester, which will include written and oral parts. The first exam will be administered in-class on Friday, 3/13, while the second exam will be administered during finals week as a self-scheduled exam. More details to come in later weeks."

    "title": "Syllabus",
    "section": "Policies",
    "text": "Policies\n\nPreparation and Attendance\nAs a four-credit course that meets 4.5 hours per week, Smith expects students to dedicate at least 7.5 hours per week towards the course outside of class. The assignments, readings, and assessments are designed with this target in mind. Expect to read through lecture notes, examples, articles, and forums outside of class along with the assignments.\nAttending class is imperative to your learning and taking part in an active community. Attendance will be taken for each class period. However, things come up and you may not have the capacity to attend. As such, you will be able to miss 3 classes with no penalty. After the third unexcused absence, your overall grade will drop by 1% for each class missed. Additional absences may be excused due to family/personal difficulties, sickness, or school or career-related activities; however, I will require some form of documentation for these absences. Please speak with your class dean or the Accessibility Resource Center so that we can get documentation of your need.\nDo make every effort to arrive to class on time. If you happen/plan to arrive more than 10 minutes late, please inform me ahead of time. Any unexplained tardiness will result in a marked absence. If you must miss a class entirely, you should contact a peer to discuss what was missed.\n\n\nExtensions\nYou will be granted 2 free late days to use for lab assignments, with a maximum of one day used on each lab assignment. Additionally, you will be granted 2 late days to use for final project submissions, with a maximum of two days used at a single time. No need to inform me that you intend to take these late days. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted without an accommodation from a class dean or from the ARC.\nNote that this policy does not apply to Perusall annotations, reading exercises, exams, or project checkpoints/proposals/presentations.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\nAs a student at Smith College, the college expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in preparation and submission of all course work and examinations, as outlined by the Academic Integrity Board (AIB). The AIB provides an Academic Integrity Statement, which all students are expected to abide by. Any cases of academic dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of these behaviors include:\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as ChatGPT without permission or instruction to do so.\n\nYou are encouraged to discuss course material, including assignments, with your classmates. All work you turn in, however, must be your own. This includes both writing and code. Copying from other students, from books, or from websites (1) does nothing to help you learn how to program, (2) is easy for us to detect, and (3) has serious negative consequences.\n\n\nGenerative AI\nAs mentioned in the Academic Integrity Board, the professor for each course decides whether and how students are allowed to use generative AI in a given course. For this specific course, any use of generative AI to complete assignments or produce content for this course is prohibited, unless otherwise stated in the assignment itself.\nAs a foundational course, it is critical that you are able to think like a data scientist, which includes producing meaningful code, developing logical solutions to problem, and critiquing good results from the bad ones. While the use of generative AI can be beneficial at producing base-level code and providing insights, it comes at the detriment of your own critical thinking. The human element will be critical in succeeding in data science. If you don’t develop the skills to understand how the underlying code is composed/works, then you will not be prepared for this kind of work.\nProhibited forms of generative AI usage include but are not limited to:\n\nSummarizing course readings.\nDrafting, editing, and proofreading responses to written prompts on any assignment.\nComposing and/or formatting code and comments.\nAnswering lab, quiz, or exam questions.\nConducting analysis of any plots, methods, and results for any assignment.\n\nAny unauthorized use of generative artificial intelligence in this course will be considered a case of academic dishonesty/plagiarism and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.\nCaveat: While the policy here is strict, do note that there will be assignments and lectures that go through the ethical and effective use of generative AI in data science as part of a unit. In these assignments, further directions will be given to showcase the use of generative AI. However, unless otherwise stated, generative AI should not be used in any assignment."

    "text": "Community & Support\n\nCode of Conduct\nAs the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack. This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nPrinciples of Community\nWhether in a class, college, or neighborhood setting, achieving a warm community is essential to your well-being. In this class, I hope we can foster a collaborative and welcoming environment: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities.\nTo establish this, consider the following:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge what we do and don’t know, as well as how our colleagues experience the world.\nSupport colleagues that may be stepping outside of their comfort zone (i.e. presentations).\nAsk questions often in our Slack workspace. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nAdmit mistakes. They happen, and I will certainly make mistakes in class.\nUse pronouns. This provides a foundation to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a sense of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\nAccommodations\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact the Accessibility Resource Center in College Hall 104 or at arc@smith.edu. The Center will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ARC, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nStudent Well-Being\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center.\nAdditional resources and support offered by the college are listed below:\n\nAccessibility Resource Center (ARC)\nSpinelli Center: Support for students doing quantitative work. Includes tutoring and resources.\n\nFor this class: Sun-Thurs, 7-9pm in Sabin-Reed 301.\nEmail qlctutor@smith.edu for specific request for help.\n\nCrisis Resources\nCounseling Services\nWellness Resources\nGender Identity and Expression\nDiscriminatory Harassment"
