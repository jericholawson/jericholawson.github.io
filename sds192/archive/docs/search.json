    "text": "Data science involves applying a set of strategies to transform a recorded set of values into something from which we can glean knowledge and insight. This course will introduce you to concepts and methods from the field of data science, along with how to apply them in R. You will learn how to acquire, clean, wrangle, and visualize data. You will also learn best practices in data science workflows, such as code documentation and version control. Issues in data ethics will be addressed throughout the course.\nClasses will be held on Mondays from 1:40 PM to 2:55 PM and on Wednesday and Thursdays from 1:20 PM to 2:35 PM.\nSDS 100: Reproducible Scientific Computing with Data is a co-requisite for this course and designed to help support you in coding in R. Please note that I walk into this course with the assumption that most students have never coded before. Coding for the first time can be intimidating, but I intend do everything in my power to support you through the learning curve and to make things both fun and relevant in the process. I personally picked up most of my data science skills through a lot of trial-and-error, practice, and curiosity. My hope is that, in this course, you will learn through experimentation, along with independent and collaborative problem-solving. Honing these competencies will serve you as you move on to other courses in the SDS program and/or at Smith.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsay Poirier, she/her/hers.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a cultural anthropologist that studies how civic data gets produced, how communities think about and interface with data, and how data infrastructure can be designed more equitably. My Ph.D. is in an interdisciplinary discipline called Science and Technology Studies - a field that studies the intricate ways science, technology, culture, and politics all co-constitute each other. I work on a number of collaborative research projects that leverage public data to deepen understanding of social and environmental inequities in the US, while also qualitatively studying the politics behind data gaps and inconsistencies. As an instructor, I prioritize active learning and often structure courses as flipped classrooms. You can expect in-class time to involve lectures, activities, and labs.\n\n\n\nSlackMeeting with Me\n\n\nI can best support students in this course when I can readily keep tabs on our course-related communication. Because of this, I ask that you please don’t email me regarding course-related questions or issues. The best way to get in touch with me is via our course Slack. If you have course-related questions, I encourage you to ask them in the #sds-192-questions channel. When discretion is needed, feel free to DM. Please reserve more formal concerns like grades or accommodation requests for an in-person (or in-person virtual) conversation.\nDuring the week, I will try my best to answer all Slack messages within 24 hours of receiving them. Please note that to maintain my own work-life balance, I don’t answer Slack messages late in the evenings or on the weekends. It’s important that you plan when you start your assignments accordingly.\n\n\nMeeting with me outside of class is a great opportunity for us to chat about what you’re learning in the course, clarify expectations on assignments, and review work in progress. I also love when students drop in to office hours to request book recommendations, discuss career or research paths, or just to say hi!\nThere are two ways to meet with me. If you would like to have a one-on-one private conversation, I ask that you schedule an appointment with me via the booking form on Moodle. For support on class topics, you may drop-in during my regularly scheduled office hours.\n\nWednesday, 2:45 PM - 3:45 PM, McConnell 214\nFriday, 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM, McConnell 214\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will make all course readings available on Perusall, which can be accessed through our course Moodle page.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Syllabus Quiz: 3%\nCourse Infrastructure Set-up: 2%\nReading Quizzes: 5%\nLabs (10): 30%\nProjects (3): 30%\nMid-term Exam: 15%\nFinal Exam: 15%\n\nAlso note that your grade may be impacted if you have more than 3 unexcused absences. See the course Attendance Policy below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacobson Center\n\n\n\nSmith’s Jacobson Center asserts that all students can improve their communication and learning skills. I encourage all students to take advantage of their writing support services, workshops, and tutors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparationAttendanceExtensionsAcademic HonestyGenerative AI\n\n\nThis is a 4-credit course with 4.5 hours per week of in-classroom instructions. Smith expects students to devote 7.5 out-of-class hours per week to 4-credit classes. I have designed the course assignments and selected the course readings with this target in mind.\n\n\nAttending class is not only important for your learning but also an act of community. Attendance will be taken each class period. That said, we all have reasons we can’t be available from time-to-time. You may miss three classes with no penalty. You do not need to inform me that you will be absent in these cases. After the third unexcused absence, your grade may drop by a modifier for each class missed. I understand that you may need to be absent beyond these three sessions. Additional absences may be excused due to family/personal difficulties, sickness, or school or career-related activities; however, I will require some form of documentation for these absences. Please speak with your class dean or the Accessibility Resource Center so that we can get documentation of your need.\nI also ask that you make every effort to arrive to class on time. This is a large course, and when students arrive late, it can be distracting for me as the instructor, and it can be distracting to other students in the course. It also makes it difficult for me to plan group activities. Students arriving more than 10 minutes late for class without having informed me ahead of time will be marked as absent.\nIf you must miss a class entirely, you should contact a peer to discuss what was missed. Please note that the SDS Program has adopted a shared policy regarding in-person attendance:\n\nIn keeping with Smith’s core identity and mission as an in-person, residential college, SDS affirms College policy (as per the Provost and Dean of the College) that students will attend class in person. SDS courses will not provide options for remote attendance. Students who have been determined to require a remote attendance accommodation by the Accessibility Resource Center will be the only exceptions to this policy. As with any other kind of ADA accommodations, please notify your instructor during the first week of classes to discuss how we can meet your accommodations.\n\n\n\nThere is an automatic 24-hour grace period on all lab and project assignments. There will be no penalties for submitting the project within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any project or lab assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted without an accommodation from a class dean or from the ARC.\nNote that this policy does not apply to reading assignments/Perusall annotations. Reading assignments/Perusall annotations need to be completed by the due date for credit.\n\n\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Any cases of dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:\n\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as chatGPT\n\n\n\nIn this course, you are learning, not only how to produce code, but also how to think like a data scientist - i.e. how to develop logical solutions to problems, how to discern a good plot from a bad one, and how to spot errors in reasoning that can lead to misleading results. If you are using generative AI to write your code, then you are not developing these foundational skills. Further, it’s important to keep in mind that, as generative AI is increasingly replacing entry level data science labor, some of the most important jobs in data science will involve being able to explain how an AI came to its results and to audit AI for errors and bias. If you don’t develop the skills to understand how the underlying code is composed/works, then you will not be prepared for this kind of work.\nWith this in mind, any use of generative AI to complete assignments or produce content for this course is prohibited. Prohibited forms of usage include but are not limited to: summarizing course readings, drafting responses to written prompts, drafting comments for Slack, composing code, formatting code, answering lab, quiz, or exam questions, or proofreading text. Any use of generative artificial intelligence in this course will be considered a case of academic dishonesty/plagiarism and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of ConductPrinciples of CommunityPronouns\n\n\nAs the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack.\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nI hope that we can foster a collaborative and caring environment in this classroom: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities. Here are some ideas that I have for creating this environment in our course:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work. “What three words describe how you’re feeling?” “Name one challenge and one success from this week.” “What are you doing for self-care right now?” Thank each other for sharing where they’re at.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge that there is much we don’t know about how our colleagues experience the world. …but don’t ask colleagues to speak on behalf of a social group you perceive them to be a part of.\nCheer on colleagues as they give presentations or try something out for the first time.\nAsk questions often in our #sds-192-questions channel. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nMistakes happen. I will certainly make mistakes in class. Admit mistakes, and then move on.\n\n\n\nUsing the proper pronouns for our students is foundational to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a culture of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodationsStudent Well-beingTrigger Warnings\n\n\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact Accessibility Resource Center in College Hall 104 or at arc@smith.edu. The Center will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ARC, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center. I can point you to these resources at any time throughout the semester.\n\n\nA trigger is a topic or image that can precipitate an intense emotional response. When common triggering topics are to be covered in this course, I will do my best to provide a trigger warning in advance of the discussion. However, I can’t always anticipate triggers. With this in mind I’ve set up an anonymous form, available on Moodle, where you can indicate topics for which you would like me to provide a warning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoodlePerusallGitHubSlack\n\n\nGrades, forms, and handouts will be available on the course Moodle.\n\n\nAll course readings and recorded lectures will be available on Perusall. You can access Perusall via our course Moodle page.\n\n\nI will be using GitHub Classroom to distribute several course assignments, including labs and projects. You will submit assignments by pushing changes to template documents to a private GitHub repository. I will provide guidance on how to do this early in the semester.\n\n\nThis class will use the R statistical software package. If you haven’t already, you will install and configure R and RStudio in SDS 100. You should let me know in the first week of the course if you are using a Chromebook or tablet.\n\n\n\nOutside of class almost all of our communication will happen via Slack. You can use the following channels\n\n#general: Course announcements (only I can post)\n#sds-192-discussions: Share news articles and relevant opportunities\n#sds-192-questions: Ask and answer questions about our course\nYou can also create private Slack channels with your project group members."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nGrading contracts have been theorized and implemented in the research of Dr. Peter Elbow and Dr. Asao Inoue. This grading contract is adapted from their work, along with the contracts of Dr. Kate Navickas and Dr. Kati Ahern.\nThis course will be using a grading contract. This means that the grade you ultimately receive for this course is primarily based on the labor that you perform rather than a subjective evaluation of the quality of your work and writing in relation to your colleagues. Your grade will be determined by the extent of your engagement in class, your timely completion of assignments, and how you support the course community. You will still attend to and work to improve the quality of your writing and thinking in this course. You will receive extensive feedback on all of your submissions (from me and from your colleagues), and you will have opportunities to revise. However, you will not receive points or an A, B, C, D, etc. on assignments.\nI’ve experimented with a few alternative grading systems, and I’m particularly excited to continue engaging this system this semester as I believe it aligns with my overarching goals for the course. In this course I am less concerned with your ability to come to a specific answer, to master certain procedures, or to produce standardized deliverables. I’m more concerned with the extent to which this course enables you become more perceptive to data environments, to deepen your critical thinking about data’s cultural meanings, to experiment with your thinking and writing, and to grapple with ethical dilemmas. There’s always room for strengthening these thinking modes further; in fact, every time I teach this course, I find that my own ability to think critically about data deepens through classroom discussions and my reading of student work.\nThere are many benefits to contract grading. Here are there reasons why I’ve opted for a grading contract in this course:"

If you receive an 80% or better on that quiz, it can replace one of your reading annotation assignments. If you receive a 100% on that quiz, it can replace two of your reading annotation assignments.\n\n\n\nDeadlines\nAssignments are due before class (2:45PM EST) on the designated due date. If you take the 24-hour grace period for written assignments (note that this is not an option for reading assignments), the assignment is due before (2:45PM EST) on the day following the designated due date. Any granted extensions are similarly due before 2:45PM EST on the date the deadline is extended to.\n\n\nEarning an A\nYou’ll notice that, in most categories, there’s no difference in the quantity of labor you need to complete to earn an A vs. a B. Earning a B in this course demonstrates that you have completed enough work to meet the course’s learning goals. An A grade in this course indicates that you have exceeded expectations of the course’s learning goals. Please note that this does not mean that you need to do more labor (i.e. more assignments) to earn A. Instead, you need to consistently demonstrate levels of critical thinking on existing course assignments that surpass the minimum requirements.\nTo earn an A in this course, you will need to complete 3 course assignments at an advanced level. You will select the assignments that you want to complete at this level from the labor log, giving you an opportunity to choose where you want to engage deeper. The following chart helps breakdown some of the differences between meeting expectations and exceeding expectations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting Expectations\nExceeding Expectations\n\n\n\n\nDefining and applying course concepts\nDrawing connections between course concepts, critiquing them, or extending them (i.e. offering new ways to think about them)\n\n\nCiting arguments from a course reading to support interpretation and ethnographic arguments\nEngaging more deeply with a course reading - unpacking how its arguments are supported and evaluating its relevance when applied to other ethnographic data\n\n\nImplementing an ethnographic research method\nDefending the selection of a research method and evaluating its strengths/limitations\n\n\nWriting up research findings to convey an argument\nExperimenting with the prose and form of argumentative writing with a clear analytic purpose\n\n\nReporting ethnographic findings in writing\nCritically situating the standpoints of your research findings throughout the writing\n\n\nAnalyzing how a social force shapes the constitution of data\nAnalyzing how multiple, at times competing, social forces shape the constitution of data\n\n\nClearly communicating the contexts that produced data in a format appropriate for a given audience\nCreatively playing with the style and medium of communication in order to better reach and engage an audience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that you may complete a reading annotation assignment at an advanced level by signing up to lead a 15-minute classroom discussion of that reading. I will remind you of this option throughout the first few weeks of the course. This is the only option for completing reading annotation assignments at an advanced level.\n\n\nThe labor log designates which assignments you may attempt to complete at an advanced level. You will be asked to justify why you consider your work on the assignment as advanced in the labor log. Please note that, when justifying why I should consider the work advanced in the labor log, you should clearly explain how the cognitive effort on the assignment surpasses minimum expectations. While you may end up writing more or spending more time on these assignments, exceeding the minimum word count or spending x hours on the assignment would not be considered adequate justification for advanced level work. Being able to justify why your work is advanced demonstrates to me that you have gained a deep understanding of the course’s learning objectives and that you have the ability to communicate what you’ve learned. While it is ultimately up to you to determine what constitutes advanced level work, I am happy to brainstorm ideas with you in office hours.\nPlease note that I reserve the right to deny advanced level designations after reviewing your work, and I also reserve the right to deem an assignment as having been completed at an advanced level, even when you haven’t designated it as such. If ultimately I deny a designation, you may attempt to earn the advanced level designation again. Note that this is a good reason not to wait until the end of the semester to attempt advanced level work.\nAttendance/late arrivals also separate A grades from B grades. Keep in mind that the final grade will be reduced by one grade modifier for each unexcused absence/late arrival beyond the number allowed for your contracted grade. This means that if you completed the work for an A, and you have 4 absences, the final grade will be an A-, and with 5 absences, it would be a B+. I chose to use grade modifiers here so that if you miss just one class beyond the first 3 allotted (i.e. 4 absences), it doesn’t drop your grade so drastically from an A to a B."

    "title": "Grading Contract",
    "section": "FAQ",
    "text": "FAQ\n\nWhat kind of feedback will I receive regarding my work?\nYou will receive extensive and timely feedback on all of your submissions (from me and from your colleagues), and you will have opportunities to revise. I will also provide rubrics for most assignments to indicate how I will evaluate your work. However, you will not receive points or an A, B, C, D, etc. on individual assignments.\n\n\nThere appear to be a significant number of assignments and deadlines in this course. Why is this the case?\nI’ve been very deliberate in pacing your assignments for this course for a number of reasons. Developing the critical thinking skills required of ethnography demands building and consistently practicing observational habits. I want you to leave this class being more mindful of the cultural forces shaping the numbers you see everyday. You are being asked to complete several short reflective writing assignments for this course so that you can start to build those habits. I am aware that this will mean that, sometimes, the writing you produce for this course will not be the very best quality you can produce. Especially for the field note assignments, I have prioritized consistency over depth of reflection because the primary goal there is to encourage you to become more habitually observant. This is also why you have the opportunity to select assignments you want to invest more time on when aiming for an A. If you are struggling with this course’s workload, I recommend coming to talk with me in office hours.\n\n\nHow can I best keep track of my labor in this course?\nThroughout the semester, you will be asked to keep track of your labor via a log that you will share with me. I will reference this log to calculate certain aspects of your final grade. Instructions for using the labor log will be provided in the second week of the course.\n\n\nCan I earn +/- grades in this course?\n+/- will be assigned to final grades at my discretion in cases where a student’s work consistently exceeds the expectations (+) of their contracted grade or is in some way insufficient (-). Students can track their progress towards a grade modifier in feedback that I provide throughout the semester. Your grade may also be reduced by a grade modifier for each missed class beyond the number associated with your contracted grade.\n\n\nWhat if I need an extension on an assignment?\nThere is a 24-hour grace period on all written assignments, except for reading annotations. There will be no penalties for submitting the written assignment within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any written assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted.\n\n\nCan I ask for extensions or use the grace period for reading annotations?\nReading assignments/Perusall annotations prepare you to participate in class discussions. For this reason, they need to be completed by the due date for credit. I’ve provided considerable leeway to miss a reading annotation assignment from time-to-time in order to accommodate flexibility in this regard.\n\n\nWhat if I don’t know how to complete an assignment at an advanced level?\nIf you are not sure how to complete assignments at an advanced level, you should plan to come talk with me in office hours. I’m more than happy to help you brainstorm ideas!\n\n\nAn assignment deadline is approaching, and I’m unhappy with the quality of my work. What should I do?\nWhile I always encourage students to strive to submit the best work they can, this course’s grading contract, coupled with the course’s revision assignments, permits you to submit work that you know you want to continue to improve upon without penalty. Not submitting assignments at all has the potentially to significantly lower your grade in this course, whereas submitting an assignment that could benefit from more revision will not be detrimental to your grade as long as the minimum submission requirements are met."

David Floyd and David Ourlicht argued that the NYPD had stopped them without reasonable suspicion, and the resulting high-profile case centered around issues of racial profiling in NYC policing. Much of the case against stop and frisk was built from data documenting racial breakdowns of the individuals stopped each year, along with the reason for the stop and the results of the stop. This data was aggregated from a series of forms (known as UF-250s) that officers are required to fill out and report following a stop. These forms collectively showed that 85% of those stopped were Black and Latino despite these sub-groups comprising just over half of the city’s population."

I want to start off the presentation by reciting an (admittedly) long quote from Sheindlen’s ruling that I think captures the key issues of this presentation:\nBecause it is impossible to individually analyze each of those stops, plaintiffs’ case was based on the imperfect information contained in the NYPD’s database of forms (‘UF-250s’) that officers are required to prepare after each stop. The central flaws in this database all skew toward underestimating the number of unconstitutional stops that occur: the database is incomplete, in that officers do not prepare a UF-250 for every stop they make; it is one-sided, in that the UF250 only records the officer’s version of the story; the UF-250 permits the officer to merely check a series of boxes, rather than requiring the officer to explain the basis for her suspicion; and many of the boxes on the form are inherently subjective and vague (such as ‘furtive movements’). Nonetheless, the analysis of the UF-250 database reveals that at least 200,000 stops were made without reasonable suspicion."

This database came into existence alongside CompStat- a crime reduction strategy implemented in NYC in the 1990s. CompStat required precincts to produce weekly statistics regarding crime rates, officer deployments, stops, and arrests in their communities in order to generate evidence of policing effectiveness. The idea was to hold officers accountable through “timely and accurate intelligence” and “relentless follow-up and assessment.” However, with certain consequences tied to failures to demonstrate reductions in crime, the policies institutionally incentivized data manipulation - an issue colloquially referred to as “juking the stats.” Whistleblowing officers have presented audio recordings of their commanders demanding that they conduct more stops to meet quotas, and deceptively classifying crimes."

These are all examples of data quality issues regarding “disclosure datasets” - tabular datasets produced in accordance with laws requiring various kinds of disclosure. The most significant defining feature of disclosure datasets is that they aggregate information produced and reported by the same institutions they are meant to hold accountable. Further, the values reported in disclosure datasets can lead to adverse actions - either formal or informal – taken against the reporting institutions. Combined, these issues institutionally incentivize misreporting and deceptive accounting practices."

We might, for instance, contrast disclosure data with evaluative data – where people and institutions are not self-assessed, but instead assessed by an external evaluator. Examples include Yelp reviews of businesses and student evaluations of teaching effectiveness. We might also contrast disclosure data with surveillance data – where real-time technological systems track activities to hold folks accountable. Examples of such data include police body cameras and consumer credit tracking. Karen Levy’s work on electronic monitoring systems in the US trucking industry provides a compelling narrative on the social impact of surveillance data. In recognition that each of these datasets emerge from situated and delimited perspectives, we can point to concerns regarding data quality and bias in all of these classes of accountability data.\nIn what follows, I will focus on three kinds of data quality concerns that arise based on the institutional configurations that underpin the production of records for disclosure datasets:"

    "text": "False Reporting\n\n\n\nLying or misreporting data\nAuditing can be challenging\n\n\n ^Sample HMDA Data Collection Form^\n\n\n\nFalse reporting involves deliberate efforts to falsify records; it’s flat out lying. While institutions that aggregate disclosure reports into a dataset often attempt to curb false reporting through auditing efforts, small scale instances of false reporting can be inordinately difficult to detect given that the data systems are designed to tell the story from the perspective of the reporters.\nFor example, in order to ensure that financial institutions are in compliance with fair lending laws in the U.S. (such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act), lenders are required to collect and report data on an applicant’s ethnicity, race, gender, and income when they apply for a mortgage. When reporting data relating to race, ethnicity, and gender, lenders are legally required to submit the information that applicants self-report when filling out a loan application to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). However, in cases where an applicant elects not to provide their demographic data, lenders are required to record race, ethnicity, and gender based on visual observation of the applicant or the applicant’s surname. In one of the most notable cases of intentional HMDA misreporting, a CFPB investigation found that, for over three years, loan officers at Freedom Mortgage (one of the top ten lending institutions in the U.S.) were instructed to list “non-Hispanic White” as the race and ethnicity for every applicant that elected not to provide demographic data.\nSimilarly one of the most novel disclosure datasets my lab has been looking at is called Open Payments. To monitor for potential medical conflicts of interest, medical drug and device companies are required to disclose payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. This is mandated by the passing of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (2010). Until recently, there has been little enforcement of the Sunshine Act, so cases of misreporting or failures to report have gone largely unrecognized. …but in 2020, the first settlement for violations to the Sunshine Act was announced. In efforts to get a South Dakota neurosurgeon to adopt their infusion pumps, Medtronic agreed to sponsor more than 100 events at a restaurant the neurosurgeon owned. Medtronic agreed to pay $9.2 million to resolve allegations for failure to report.\nIn terms of data quality, false reporting calls into question the accuracy and validity of the data."

    "text": "Deceptive Accounting\n\n\n\nNot technically false but deliberately misleading\nTakes advantage of ambiguities in standards or laws\nOften involves “creative” approaches to measurement or classification\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can trace other cases of reporting that result in information that is not technically false, but deliberately misleading. For instance, institutions might take advantage of loopholes in reporting standards or leverage vagueness in the reporting requirements to cast their activities in a more positive light.\nAn example of this comes from the environmental health domain. The EPA’s Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986 established the Toxic Release Inventory as a mechanism to monitor and inform the public of toxic emissions released in their communities. Every year, certain U.S. industrial facilities are required to report to the EPA the amounts of certain chemical on-site and off-site releases.\nNotably, while this Act mandates reporting of emissions, it does not mandate monitoring of emissions. While other environmental regulations do set certain monitoring standards for specific TRI chemicals and pollution activities, for all other chemicals and activities, facilities are required to report based on a “reasonable estimate” of releases and other waste management quantities. Because the data is self-reported, this provides a lot of flexibility to facilities to determine how they go about measuring emissions. Studies have shown that year-to-year changes in emissions at large facilities often have more to do with changes in estimation methods and interpretations of the law, rather than actual reductions in emissions. These are often called “phantom reductions” - where emissions just disappear from the books without indication of how the facility actually cleaned up their act.\nIn our research into disclosure datasets, my lab has identified a number of other examples of deceptive accounting. For instance, when reporting campaign spending, candidates will sometimes hide large payments by submitting them to consulting firms that then disburse the payments to other organizations. Historically, candidates did not have to disclose the payments’ ultimate recipients. …and the concept of “juking the stats” in policing is a direct example of this deceptive accounting practice, with officers learning to play the CompStat numbers game.\nIn terms of data quality, deceptive accounting calls into question the representativeness of the data - or in other words, the degree to which it represents what we think it represents."

    "text": "Discursive Risk of Regulatory Burden\n\nScope of dataset determined by reporting thresholds\nStakeholders have advocated for strengthening or loosening thresholds in line with certain political commitments\n“Regulatory burden” discourse has been powerful tool for loosening reporting requirements\n\n\nFinally, the information that ultimately appears in a disclosure dataset is often shaped by a series of legal standards regarding who has to report and when they have to report. These standards are not neutral, and tend to evolve as stakeholders with certain political commitments towards transparency and institutional accountability call for amendments. Certain stakeholders advocate on behalf of stricter requirements and more data reporting in efforts to secure transparency and accountability, whereas other stakeholders advocate on behalf of loosening the requirements. Notably, one of the most powerful weapons against strengthening disclosure dataset programs has been discourse around “regulatory burden”. Businesses cite the cost and lack of feasibility of filling out paperwork when advocating against data collection. For instance, under the George W. Bush Administration, the TRI “Burden Reduction Rule” significantly raised the threshold regarding how much pollution a facility needed to emit before reporting requirements kicked in. Just recently, amendments to HMDA raised the threshold regarding the volume of loans a bank needs a originate for reporting requirements to kick in. The pressures Covid-19 had placed on banks was cited as a reason for this change. … and regulatory burden discourse has been effectively leveraged to keep the US’s National Use of Force database – where police officers disclose when they use force against citizens – a voluntary data program.\nWhen regulatory burden discourse is successful, fewer institutions are required to report on fewer activities, diminishing what is tracked in the data. Thresholds tend to fluctuate in line with political changeover. For instance, the stringency of TRI reporting often correlates with the political leanings of presidential administrations. This has meant that the definitions underpinning disclosure datasets are quite malleable - subject to change in conjunction with different modes of social advocacy. This malleability is a double-edged sword for many community groups calling for increased accountability. In one sense, it ensures that disclosure programs can continuously be strengthened. However, changing reporting standards makes it difficult to perform year-to-year comparisons of the data. …which is often needed to measure whether institutions are “cleaning up” their acts.\nIn terms of data quality, this discursive risk calls into question the scope and comprehensiveness of the data."

    "text": "Final Project Resources\nThis semester your project group will develop a user guide for a federal dataset. You will complete a series of exercises in class to support you in writing the guide. These exercises are not graded; they are meant to frame your research and help you generate material for the project. You should work on relevant aspects of them weekly with your group in order to make progress towards the final product. While these exercises will include both qualitative and computational exercises, the point of this project is not to perform a statistical analysis on this dataset. Instead, you will study the dataset ethnographically and strive to effectively communicate how the dataset came to be, how it has disseminated, how it can be used, and what some of its limitations are.\n\nProject Description\nRose’s Project Guide Sheet\nDataset Loading Instructions\nExample User Guide\n\nBelow I’ve outlined completion criteria for the two non-written assignments for this course.\n\nReading Annotations\nEach week a selection of course readings will be posted as a single assignment on Perusall - a system for students to collaboratively annotate course readings. To earn this credit, you will be expected to post 3 quality annotations per assignment to Perusall. (Note that a single assignment can have multiple readings, but you need only submit 3 annotations total. You do not need to annotate every reading in the assignment.) A quality annotation is one in which you synthesize concepts, ask thought-provoking questions, or connect ideas to external issues. I have found that students get the most out of Perusall when they respond to each other’s annotations. Annotations must be completed before class to receive credit.\n\n\nCommunity Labor\nEthnography is at its best when it involves collaborative inquiry and interpretation. Because of this, I want to encourage us to foster a cooperative community in our classroom. Ethnographers know that building and sustaining strong communities are important and often invisible forms of labor. In an effort to foreground and reward that labor, I’ve built opportunities to contribute to the course community into our grading contract. There are four opportunities for earning community labor points in this course. It will be your responsibility to keep track of your community labor via our course labor log (see FAQ).\n\nContributing on Slack\nThe first opportunity for earning community labor points is through posting in the #sds-237-discussions Slack channel. For every conversation that you initiate in this channel, you will earn 1 community labor point. For every conversation that you respond to in this channel with substantive summary, critique, or reflection, you will earn 1 community labor point. Finally, for every question that you answer in the #sds-237-questions channel, you will earn 1 community labor point.\n\n\nCompleting Group Evaluations\nMid-way through the semester you will have an opportunity to evaluate your own contributions to your group work, along with that of your peers. Your feedback will be shared with members of your group. Completing group evaluations will count for 1 community labor point.\n\n\nParticipating in Peer Review Workshops\nThroughout the semester, I will set up workshops where students may submit their written work for peer review in preparation for assignment submissions. Each peer review workshop that you participate in will count for 2 community labor points.\n\n\nContributing Class Notes\nFollowing a class period, up to two students may type up a 1-page outline of what was covered in that class period and post a link to that outline in #sds-237-class-notes. You can sign-up to serve as the notetaker for a certain class here. These notes should be a full, single-space page, and should make sense to someone that was not present in class. Each class note outline that you contribute will count for 2 community labor points.\nNote that throughout the semester, I may offer additional opportunities to earn community labor points as unexpected forms of course labor arise.\n\nThe final project will be completed in groups, and considerable chunks of the group project will be completed in class on Thursdays. While I will not formally be taking attendance for this course, I reserve the right to adjust your final grade by a letter grade if you’ve missed more than three classes involving final project group work. Be sure to reach out to me early on if there are extenuating circumstances that will consistently impact your attendance."

    "text": "Mini-Projects + Substantive Revision\nThe course mini-projects will provide you with opportunities to practice ethnographic research and cultural analysis. Mini-projects are the predominant way that you will practice the Data Ethnography Methods learning dimension in this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPlease note that you may complete the mini-projects independently or in a pair. If you choose to complete the project as a pair, both students must participate in data collection, analysis, and writing. Be prepared to submit a short paragraph describing the breakdown of labor, along with your write-up.\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nIdentify, implement, and critique data ethnography research methods\nDevelop observational habits in data-saturated environments\nDevelop skill in analyzing social forces and systems\nPlan and execute a substantive writing revision, while evaluating feedback\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\nInfrastructural Analysis (MP 1)Discourse Analysis (MP 1)Interview (MP 2)Participant Observation (MP 2)\n\n\nFor this assignment, you will select a standard classification system that supports a dataset or system. You will then investigate that information infrastructure through a socio-cultural lens, aiming to respond to the question: What is a cultural assumption embedded in this classification system that goes on to shape the social outcomes of the data it supports? You may briefly research the history of changes to the infrastructure; however, this assignment is not a literature review, and you should limit your use of secondary sources to support your arguments. This paper should represent your cultural analysis of this dataset, not that of others. To do so, you should closely examine the structure of the classification system, using the Infrastructural Analysis Worksheet.\n\nSelecting a data infrastructure\nBefore you select an infrastructure, you should identify a public dataset that organizes information into a series categories\nExamples of classification systems that I’ve seen referenced in public datasets include:\n\nStandard Industrial Classification System (SIC) or the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS)\nCarnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education\nBISAC Subject Headings List\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)\nUniform Crime Reporting crime classifications\nAssociation of Computing Machinery (ACM) Computing Classification System\nCandid’s Philanthropy Classification System (PCS)\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the data infrastructure\nTo analyze this infrastructure, you should complete the Infrastructural Analysis Worksheet, which you will submit along with the final write-up. You should aim to answer most of the questions in this worksheet, but you do not need to answer all of them. To answer these questions, you can rely on a diverse range of resources. First and foremost, you should browse the classification system itself, noting how concepts are organized. However, to answer the questions in the worksheet, you may also need to review the websites of the organizations that created/steward the classification, review changelogs that identify changes to the classification, and conduct research to find journal articles, news articles, blog posts, or other grey literature, discussing the classification.Finally, you should consider how everything you learned shaped the way values are presented in the dataset where you originally identified this infrastructure.\n\n\nWrite-up\nFollowing your analysis, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo presenting an an answer to the question: What is a cultural assumption embedded in this classification system that goes on to shape the social outcomes of the data it supports? I encourage you to use this memo template for outlining your write-up. You should engage thick description as you detail the structure and organization of the infrastructure and interpret its symbolic meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nI want to emphasize that this is not a literature review, and you should not approach this assignment simply by regurgitating what you learn in sources you find. Instead, you should focus on analyzing the ways in which the infrastructure both enables and delimits knowledge production by closely studying how its component parts are organized and how they impact your dataset, along with which stakeholder groups advocated for certain changes. The sources you find should serve to provide context for the points that you make. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent submits a mostly complete Infrastructural Analysis Worksheet.\nStudent writes a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting the data infrastructure. All sources are properly cited in the write-up.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph.\n\n\n\n\nFor this assignment, you have two options: you can 1) watch 1 video (at least 45 minutes long) of a talk about data delivered by a data scientist, or 2) three TED talks (at least 15 minutes each) about data. Please confirm your selection with me ahead of time by DM’ing me on Slack.\n\nAnalyzing the talks\nFollowing the framework in the Discourse Analysis Worksheet, you should examine how data is talked about in the video(s). Consider the epistemologies vocalized, the binary oppositions that structure the language, the rhetorical strategies used, and what this tells us about data culture. You should take detailed notes by responding to several sections within the worksheet. As “data” to back up claims regarding what you notice about the discourse, you should transcribe a series of quotes from the talks. You can add these quotes directly to the worksheet. You will submit the worksheet with your final write-up.\n\n\nWrite-up\nFollowing your analysis, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo detailing an argument about the data discourse conveyed in the talk(s). What cultural assumptions about (choose one): 1) what data is, 2) data’s relationship with truth, or 3) what makes data good vs. bad … are reflected in discourse about data? I encourage you to use this memo template for outlining your write-up. Direct quotations should be referenced throughout (and cited) to back up your claims, but do not count towards the overall word count. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you choose to watch three TED Talks, please note that you should still only present one argument, synthesizing what you learn across all three videos. This means that you should compare discourse across multiple talks in each paragraph. Assignments that present three distinct discourse analyses/do not offer in-paragraph synthesis and comparison will not receive full credit.\n\n\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent submits the Discourse Analysis Worksheet with several sections completed.\nStudent writes a 750-1000 word memo detailing the discourse of the talk(s). Direct quotations are included as evidence, and not included in the overall word count.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph. If analyzing multiple talks, student offers comparison and synthesis in each paragraph.\n\n\n\n\nFor this assignment you will conduct a 30-minute Zoom interview with an individual for whom data figures centrally in their work. The goal of your interview will be to deepen understanding of the cultures of data work.\n\nIdentifying a data professional, scheduling an interview, and obtaining consent\nIf you choose this assignment, it will be your responsibility to identify a data professional, reach out to them (cc’ing me), and coordinate an interview time well in advance of the project due date. There is a template for emailing an individual provided here, along with a consent form the person you interview should sign. Keep in mind that, while your SDS professors may be an obvious first choice, they cannot support interviews with all of the students in our course. I encourage you to think expansively about who you might interview. I’m happy to offer suggestions on identifying an appropriate person in office hours.\n\n\nPreparing for the interview\nYour interview should address the question: How does the interviewee define the boundaries of data science? How do they define/what do they consider legitimate data science expertise? Write up 10 open-ended questions in preparation for the interview that aim to unpack this theme. You should submit these 10 interview questions along with your memo in your Google Drive.\n\n\nDuring the interview\nAsk the interviewee if they are comfortable with you recording the conversation. You may record with their express permission. If they do not agree to recording, you should be prepared to take notes during the interview.\n\n\nAnalyzing the interview\nYou may wish to use this worksheet to help you with your analysis. However, you are not required to submit this worksheet with your memo.\n\n\nWrite-up\nFollowing your interview, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting what was discussed throughout the conversation. Your write-up should address the prompt: How does the interviewee define the boundaries of data science? How do they define/what do they consider legitimate data science expertise? I encourage you to use this memo template for outlining your write-up. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent writes/submits 10 relevant interview questions developed in preparation for the interview.\nStudent writes/submits a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting what was discussed in the interview.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph.\n\n\n\n\nFor this assignment, you will observe a setting in which data figures centrally. You may choose to observe a class engaging in some form of data collection, a hack-a-thon, or even a friend working on a coding assignment for a data science course. The only data setting that I discourage for this assignment is talks that are being presented on-line. These are better suited for the discourse analysis mini-project. As you observe, you will be aiming to gather data that addresses one of the following two questions: 1) How are data practices embodied in this data environment, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data? OR 2) What rituals are engaged in this data, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data?\n\nBefore the Event\nPrior to your observation, you need to obtain permission to observe. If you are observing a class, you should get permission from the instructor. If you are observing an event, you should get permission from the organizer. …if a lab, get permission from the lab manager or faculty director, etc. Be sure to cc me when you email to obtain permission. You may use this email template when obtaining permission.\n\n\nDuring the Observation\nThroughout the event you should take extensive field notes (at least 6 double-spaced, typed pages) about the physical environment of the event, how people behave and interact, how people talk about and data, the rituals they perform, the infrastructures they engage, and more generally how data figures into the social setting. You may talk to individuals in the environment to ask clarifying question, but if you do, you should disclose that you are an ethnographer studying the space.\n\n\nAnalyzing the Observation\nYou may wish to use this worksheet to help you with your analysis. However, you are not required to submit this worksheet with your memo.\n\n\nWrite-up\nFollowing your observation, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo describing the event and offering a qualitative interpretive analysis responding to either 1) How are data practices embodied in this data environment, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data? OR 2) What rituals are engaged in this data, and with what outcomes/consequences for the data?. I encourage you to use this memo template for outlining your write-up. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent submits the equivalent of about 6 double-spaced typed pages of field notes taken during the event.\nStudent writes/submits a 750-1000 word memo describing and interpreting the event.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevision\nAfter receiving feedback from me on both submissions, you will have an opportunity to revise one of your submissions. This assignment has three steps:\n\nRead this document on creating a revision plan.\nComplete the Revision Plan worksheet.\nRevise your submission in the same document you had previously been working in based on what you outlined in your revision plan.\n\n\nRemember that grammar, spelling, and punctuation concerns should not be included in a revision plan. Those concerns are addressed in a proofreading stage, not a revising stage.\n\n\n\nResources\n\nMemo template is here\nExample Mini-Project 1 are here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDue to IRB restrictions, I cannot provide examples of past Mini-Project 2 assignments. If you are struggling to figure out how to compose the write-up, please plan to visit office hours."

    "section": "Final Project",
    "text": "Final Project\nIn May 2009, Data.gov - a web portal for accessing US government datasets - was launched by then federal Chief Information Officer Vivek Kundra. Following this, in December 2009, then US President Barack Obama signed the Open Government Data Directive, requiring that all federal agencies post at least 3 high value datasets on data.gov within 45 day. A few years later in May 2013, Pres. Obama signed an Executive Order to: “Mak[e] Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information.”\nThe Order required that the US Office of Management and Budgeting, in collaboration with the CIO and CTO, put out and oversee an Open Data Policy. This policy required the following:\n\nData needs to be published in machine-readable formats\nData needs to be licensed openly\nData needs to be described with metadata.\n\n\nPrompt\nFor this assignment, I would like you to imagine that the Data.gov Program Management Office in US General Services Administration Technology Transformation Services, the Office of Government and Information Services (OGIS), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) are jointly championing a new initiative to improve the accessibility of open government metadata. Administrative metadata describing how datasets are managed or stewarded gets published with most open government datasets. Similarly, descriptive metadata gets published in the form of data dictionaries that provide official definitions of observations and variables present in the dataset. However, user-friendly descriptions of how the dataset was produced, how standard definitions were chosen, how categories were divided, how measurements get taken, what assumptions and judgments are built into the data, why certain information may be missing, and where and how the data gets referenced is often harder to come by and rarely published in a succinct format accessible to diverse users.\nTo help advance this initiative, imagine the offices will be contracting with a number of teams of consultants to develop a series of dataset user guides. Unlike many existing metadata formats, dataset user guides will be narrative documents. In the process of advancing a similar municipal level initiative, the NYC Open Data Team (with Julia Marden, Tiny Panther Consulting, Sharon Lintz and Jo Polanco) defined dataset user guides as describing “the content of a dataset, how it was created, the agency who maintains it, and how users can begin to use the data.”\nThis semester your project group will develop a user guide for a federal dataset. Each week you will work through exercises that help apply course concepts from that week to the study of this dataset. Note that you will study the dataset ethnographically and strive to effectively communicate how the dataset came to be, how it has disseminated, how it can be used, and what some of its limitations are.\nYour final user guide may be presented in any format you wish, and I encourage you to be creative. However, the format you choose should be tailored to an audience that you identify in advance.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nApply the course concepts in studying the provenance of a dataset\nDevelop skill in analyzing social forces and systems\nProduce effective and descriptive data documentation that puts data in context\nPlan and execute a substantive writing revision, while evaluating feedback\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nGroup Contract\nSemiotic Analysis\nPeopling the Data\nData Collection Rituals\nInstitutional Incentives\nDiscourse Analysis\n\n\n\nAssignment Expectations\n\nThe exercises I provide are not graded and not reviewed by me; they are meant to frame your research and help you generate material for the project. I will only be formally reviewing your final user guide submission.\nBecause each group is working on a different dataset, there will likely be components of each exercise that are not relevant to your group; I only expect you to complete about 70% of each exercise. Skip the parts that aren’t relevant to you.\nYou should be meeting with your groups at least one hour each week outside of class to coordinate your work and plan to work an additional hour independently to make progress towards your research.\nThe point of this project is not to perform a statistical analysis on this dataset. Instead, you will study the dataset ethnographically and strive to effectively communicate how the dataset came to be, how it has disseminated, how it can be used, and what some of its limitations are.\nBy November, at least part of your group work time should transition from researching the dataset to composing a user guide. Your final submission should not be a compilation of text from the exercises you completed. That text was written for you, not for an outside audience. Part of the goal of this project is to be able to translate your research into information that is accessible to an audience.\n\n\n\nProject Resources\n\nExample User Guide\n\n\n\nCriteria for Completion\n\nStudent team submits a completed group contract, first draft, and final project draft on time.\nStudent team generates a user guide that demonstrates having completed substantial research across all five project exercises.\nStudent team generates a user guide with language, visuals, and formats tailored towards a particular audience."

    "text": "Community Labor\nEthnography is at its best when it involves collaborative inquiry and interpretation. Because of this, I want to encourage us to foster a cooperative community in our classroom. Ethnographers know that building and sustaining strong communities are important and often invisible forms of labor. In an effort to foreground and reward that labor, I’ve built opportunities to contribute to the course community into our grading contract. There are four opportunities for earning community labor points in this course. It will be your responsibility to keep track of your community labor via our course labor log.\n\nContributing on Slack\nThe first opportunity for earning community labor points is through posting in the #sds-237-discussions Slack channel. For every conversation that you initiate in this channel, you will earn 1 community labor point. For every conversation that you respond to in this channel with substantive summary, critique, or reflection, you will earn 1 community labor point. Finally, for every question that you ask or answer in the #sds-237-questions channel, you will earn 1 community labor point.\n\n\nCompleting Group Evaluations\nMid-way through the semester you will have an opportunity to evaluate your own contributions to your group work, along with that of your peers. Completing group evaluations will count for 1 community labor point.\n\n\nParticipating in Peer Review Workshops\nThroughout the semester, I will set up workshops where students may submit their written work for peer review in preparation for assignment submissions. Each peer review workshop that you participate in will count for 2 community labor points.\n\n\nContributing Class Notes\nFollowing a class period, up to two students may type up a 1-page outline of what was covered in that class period and post a link to that outline in #sds-237-class-notes. You can sign-up to serve as the notetaker for a certain class here. These notes should be a full, single-space page, and should make sense to someone that was not present in class. Each class note outline that you contribute will count for 2 community labor points.\nNote that throughout the semester, I may offer additional opportunities to earn community labor points as unexpected forms of course labor arise."

It also serves the whole class to have everyone know the course syllabus; knowing the syllabus sets standards for how we will learn as a community, and it also reduces the class time spent answering questions that have already been documented.\nAfter reading the syllabus, you should complete the 20 question syllabus quiz in Perusall.

    "text": "This entry documents a data environment Casey MacGibbon observed on 2023-02-10 in The Human Performance Labratory, Scott Gym, Smith College. The observations were written up on 2023-02-19.\nMy stopwatch hits 20:00:00.\n“Alright, it’s been five minutes since I last asked, how rigorous do you feel your exercise is on a scale of 6-20?” I say, holding up a reference board for the participant. She points to a 12, which is labeled as “Somewhat hard.” She is on minute twenty of her acute bout of exercise, where she is walking at a moderate pace on the treadmill, and we are monitoring her heart rate from an electronic wristband.\nRecently, I have begun research work and analysis for the Witkowski Vascular Function Lab, and this was the first time I went in to observe a visit with a participant. I am new to the lab, and my perspective still feels a bit like an outsiders’. After the visit, I asked Dr. Witkowski explained that each number on the reference board corresponded to a heart rate by multiplying the number by 10, essentially acting as a participant’s heart rate experience. She explained to me how there are two different “data streams” throughout the lab, one being objective and the other subjective.\nThe idea of objective/subjective data is an example of a binary opposition: a pair of terms with opposite meanings. I noticed how much more “objective” data collection was valued, while a lot of the data collected from the participant was thought of as “subjective,” and thought of to be more subject to inaccuracy. Data is categorized as one or the other.\nNo data can be subjective, because the mere decision to begin collecting data means that there are expectations and biases put into the collection of data. Though the target heart rate is an “objective” part of the study because it is numerical, does not mean it is without bias. Heart rate calculations have historically ignored weight, height, average physical activity, and many other factors. This is just one example of how all of the data is biased, and cannot be placed into these categorizations. Additionally, the “data streams” figure of speech is a part of popular data discourse, contributing to the idea that data is a natural resource waiting to be found, untainted and untouched by human interference.\nDiscourse is the way that people talk about and engage with a certain thing/person, and dominant discourse can often characterize how we think about this topic as a society. The imagery of a data stream indicates that data is natural and is something we can “drink” from at any time. In reality, all data is collected from humans, who are limited in their standpoints and views."

The observations were written up on 2023-03-29.\n\nPlease note that certain details in this entry were anonymized for the purposes of sharing. Names and titles have been changed.\n\nThe Center [redacted] is on the first floor of [redacted] down a long hall of labs. I go there regularly for my research project and am always greeted with a friendly face – Morgan. They’re the technical director of the Center and help students with research. This includes teaching students to use instruments that some senior researchers don’t even get their hands on. They’re a patient teacher and helpful during experiments. They’re also a core part of a lot of the data labor (work that goes into creating, supporting, processing, and analyzing information) that happens in my research field.\nWhile Morgan is highly valued on a personal amongst colleagues, on an institutional level, they disappear a little bit. While most people outside the department recognize the research professors do, Morgan fades into the background a little more. They also don’t get to do their own research, and the Center’s budget is generally devoted to making sure professors get what they need for their research. As a result, despite the amount that they help with student research, Morgan rarely gets put on papers as an author.\nHowever, Morgan does love their job. They’re excellent at training people on equipment and prefer being technical support to lecturing. They know the ins and outs of the instruments and do more hands-on work than most professors. Data produced in the Center is as accurate and uncontaminated as possible because of the care that they take when working. The data provides an excellent basis for publications. However, the labor that went into creating that data is hidden in the final publication.\nThis obscuration of labor says a lot about what kind of labor academia values. Spoiler alert: it’s not “grunt” work. Instead, it values high level thinking. This ignores that the “grunt” work also requires expertise and is vital to the research that professors do. As an undergraduate researcher who gets to be first author but also is doing the “grunt” work, it is easy to see this discrepancy. I do actively benefit from this hierarchy in many ways because of my educational and career trajectory, but it appears that the more one benefits, the harder it is to notice. This is partially because the people who benefit most often don’t do much lab work.\n…I will add more as I get permission from former students."

    "text": "Field Notes\nEthnographers keep field journals to thickly document what they observe in social environments. Typically field notes will describe a physical environment and the participants in that environment (including appearances, roles, behaviors, moods, interactions, conversations, etc.). Field notes will also interpret what was observed, considering how the empirical material affirms, contests, or transforms how we understand cultural phenomena. In data ethnography, the social environment under consideration can be anywhere data is produced, applied, presented, or talked about. This assignment is about paying attention to the numbers (and other forms of data) that inhabit daily life and practicing cultural interpretation.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nRecall, define, explain, apply, and synthesize course concepts and ideas\nEngage the genre and practice of thick description\nDevelop observational habits in data-saturated environments\nDevelop skill in interpreting cultural meaning\n\n\n\nInstructions\nConsider a statistic, dataset, data standard, data infrastructure, or data collection environment that you encountered in the past two weeks. Write 300-400 words, first, detailing the environment and, second, responding to one of the following prompts.\n\nWhat cultural assumptions about what knowledge is and how knowledge is produced can you glean from this data environment?\nHow do binary oppositions structure discourse about data in this environment? With what consequences?\nWhat metaphors are used to characterize data in this environment, and what assumptions about data are conveyed through these metaphors?\nWhat is one master narrative architecturally designed into this data infrastructure? How does that narrative manifest both semiotically and materially through the data infrastructure?\nWhat invisible forms of labor sustain this data infrastructure or data environment? How do the individuals that engage in that labor approach and care for their work? What social forces render that work invisible?\nHow is data science defined in this space? Through what kinds of boundary work do social groups advocate for what should count as legitimate data science? What are the social consequences of this definitional work?\nWhat counts as credible data expertise in this data environment? How do these ideas mediate who gets a voice in the data environment?\nIn what ways are data practices embodied in this environment? How does attention to embodied practice change the ways we understand the data?\nWhat rituals do data collectors engage in this data environment? What shared beliefs motivate these rituals, and how do the rituals manifest in the “raw” data that gets produced?\nWhat stakes do individuals have in how numbers in this data environment get reported? How do social or financial incentives to have the numbers meet or beat certain thresholds animate how individuals behave and the choices they make in relation to this data collection practice, data analysis, or data reporting? Why do those incentives exist?\nHow is the meaning of this statistic or data value socially debated, negotiated, or settled upon? At what thresholds do the data values become actionable, and how do social groups determine levels of actionability? How and under what conditions do these decisions get made?\nHow are data socially mobilized in this space? What strategies do individuals, institutions, or social groups engage to render the data persuasive?\n\n\n\nSample Work\n\nPrevious Student Field Notes here\nHere’s an example of some very short ““thick description”” write-ups of two data environments from my own research.\n\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent writes 300-400 words about a statistic, dataset, data standard, or data collection environment.\nStudent writes about a data situation encountered in the past two weeks.\nStudent responds to a prompt, engaging course concepts to interpret the cultural meaning of the data situation analyzed."

What cultural assumptions about data are reflected in the discourse, and through what linguistic structures are those assumptions conveyed? Direct quotations should be referenced throughout (and cited) to back up your claims, but do not count towards the overall word count. Your write-up should have introductory and concluding paragraphs that clearly indicate the central point you are making in the write-up and that point should be carried through all of the examples and arguments presented in the write-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you choose to watch three TED Talks, please note that you should still only present one argument, synthesizing what you learn across all three videos. This means that you should compare discourse across multiple talks in each paragraph. Assignments that present three distinct discourse analyses/do not offer in-paragraph synthesis and comparison will not receive full credit.\n\n\n\nCriteria for completion\n\nStudent responds to at least one of the questions in each of the nine sections of the Discourse Analysis Worksheet.\nStudent writes a 750-1000 word memo detailing the discourse of the talk(s). Direct quotations are included as evidence, and not included in the overall word count.\nStudent synthesizes evidence into one argument, presented at the start of the write-up and carried through each paragraph.

My Ph.D. is in an interdisciplinary discipline called Science and Technology Studies - a field that studies the intricate ways science, technology, culture, and politics all co-constitute each other. I work on a number of collaborative research projects that leverage public data to deepen understanding of social and environmental inequities in the US, while also qualitatively studying the politics behind data gaps and inconsistencies. As an instructor, I prioritize active learning and often structure courses as flipped classrooms. You can expect in-class time to involve lectures, activities, and labs.\n\n\n\nSlackMeeting with Me\n\n\nI can best support students in this course when I can readily keep tabs on our course-related communication. Because of this, I ask that you please don’t email me regarding course-related questions or issues. The best way to get in touch with me is via our course Slack. If you have course-related questions, I encourage you to ask them in the #sds-192-questions channel. When discretion is needed, feel free to DM. Please reserve more formal concerns like grades or accommodation requests for an in-person (or in-person virtual) conversation.\nDuring the week, I will try my best to answer all Slack messages within 24 hours of receiving them. Please note that to maintain my own work-life balance, I don’t answer Slack messages late in the evenings or on the weekends. It’s important that you plan when you start your assignments accordingly.\n\n\nMeeting with me outside of class is a great opportunity for us to chat about what you’re learning in the course, clarify expectations on assignments, and review work in progress. I also love when students drop in to office hours to request book recommendations, discuss career or research paths, or just to say hi!\nThere are two ways to meet with me. If you would like to have a one-on-one private conversation, I ask that you schedule an appointment with me via the booking form on Moodle. For support on class topics, you may drop-in during my regularly scheduled office hours.\n\nWednesday, 2:45 PM - 3:45 PM, McConnell 214\nFriday, 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM, McConnell 214"

    "text": "PreparationAttendanceExtensionsAcademic HonestyGenerative AI\n\n\nThis is a 4-credit course with 4.5 hours per week of in-classroom instructions. Smith expects students to devote 7.5 out-of-class hours per week to 4-credit classes. I have designed the course assignments and selected the course readings with this target in mind.\n\n\nAttending class is not only important for your learning but also an act of community. Attendance will be taken each class period. That said, we all have reasons we can’t be available from time-to-time. You may miss three classes with no penalty. You do not need to inform me that you will be absent in these cases. After the third unexcused absence, your grade may drop by a modifier for each class missed. I understand that you may need to be absent beyond these three sessions. Additional absences may be excused due to family/personal difficulties, sickness, or school or career-related activities; however, I will require some form of documentation for these absences. Please speak with your class dean or the Accessibility Resource Center so that we can get documentation of your need.\nI also ask that you make every effort to arrive to class on time. This is a large course, and when students arrive late, it can be distracting for me as the instructor, and it can be distracting to other students in the course. It also makes it difficult for me to plan group activities. Students arriving more than 10 minutes late for class without having informed me ahead of time will be marked as absent.\nIf you must miss a class entirely, you should contact a peer to discuss what was missed. Please note that the SDS Program has adopted a shared policy regarding in-person attendance:\n\nIn keeping with Smith’s core identity and mission as an in-person, residential college, SDS affirms College policy (as per the Provost and Dean of the College) that students will attend class in person. SDS courses will not provide options for remote attendance. Students who have been determined to require a remote attendance accommodation by the Accessibility Resource Center will be the only exceptions to this policy. As with any other kind of ADA accommodations, please notify your instructor during the first week of classes to discuss how we can meet your accommodations.\n\n\n\nThere is an automatic 24-hour grace period on all lab and project assignments. There will be no penalties for submitting the project within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any project or lab assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted without an accommodation from a class dean or from the ARC.\nNote that this policy does not apply to reading assignments/Perusall annotations. Reading assignments/Perusall annotations need to be completed by the due date for credit.\n\n\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Any cases of dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:\n\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as chatGPT\n\n\n\nIn this course, you are learning, not only how to produce code, but also how to think like a data scientist - i.e. how to develop logical solutions to problems, how to discern a good plot from a bad one, and how to spot errors in reasoning that can lead to misleading results. If you are using generative AI to write your code, then you are not developing these foundational skills. Further, it’s important to keep in mind that, as generative AI is increasingly replacing entry level data science labor, some of the most important jobs in data science will involve being able to explain how an AI came to its results and to audit AI for errors and bias. If you don’t develop the skills to understand how the underlying code is composed/works, then you will not be prepared for this kind of work.\nWith this in mind, any use of generative AI to complete assignments or produce content for this course is prohibited. Prohibited forms of usage include but are not limited to: summarizing course readings, drafting responses to written prompts, drafting comments for Slack, composing code, formatting code, answering lab, quiz, or exam questions, or proofreading text. Any use of generative artificial intelligence in this course will be considered a case of academic dishonesty/plagiarism and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board."

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack.\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nI hope that we can foster a collaborative and caring environment in this classroom: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities. Here are some ideas that I have for creating this environment in our course:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work. “What three words describe how you’re feeling?” “Name one challenge and one success from this week.” “What are you doing for self-care right now?” Thank each other for sharing where they’re at.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge that there is much we don’t know about how our colleagues experience the world. …but don’t ask colleagues to speak on behalf of a social group you perceive them to be a part of.\nCheer on colleagues as they give presentations or try something out for the first time.\nAsk questions often in our #sds-192-questions channel. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nMistakes happen. I will certainly make mistakes in class. Admit mistakes, and then move on.\n\n\n\nUsing the proper pronouns for our students is foundational to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a culture of trust.

If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact Accessibility Resource Center in College Hall 104 or at arc@smith.edu. The Center will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ARC, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center. I can point you to these resources at any time throughout the semester.\n\n\nA trigger is a topic or image that can precipitate an intense emotional response. When common triggering topics are to be covered in this course, I will do my best to provide a trigger warning in advance of the discussion. However, I can’t always anticipate triggers. With this in mind I’ve set up an anonymous form, available on Moodle, where you can indicate topics for which you would like me to provide a warning."

The observations were written up on 2023-02-19.\nMy stopwatch hits 20:00:00.\n“Alright, it’s been five minutes since I last asked, how rigorous do you feel your exercise is on a scale of 6-20?” I say, holding up a reference board for the participant. She points to a 12, which is labeled as “Somewhat hard.” She is on minute twenty of her acute bout of exercise, where she is walking at a moderate pace on the treadmill, and we are monitoring her heart rate from an electronic wristband.\nRecently, I have begun research work and analysis for the Witkowski Vascular Function Lab, and this was the first time I went in to observe a visit with a participant. I am new to the lab, and my perspective still feels a bit like an outsiders’. After the visit, I asked Dr. Witkowski explained that each number on the reference board corresponded to a heart rate by multiplying the number by 10, essentially acting as a participant’s heart rate experience. She explained to me how there are two different “data streams” throughout the lab, one being objective and the other subjective.\nThe idea of objective/subjective data is an example of a binary opposition: a pair of terms with opposite meanings. I noticed how much more “objective” data collection was valued, while a lot of the data collected from the participant was thought of as “subjective,” and thought of to be more subject to inaccuracy. Data is categorized as one or the other.\nNo data can be subjective, because the mere decision to begin collecting data means that there are expectations and biases put into the collection of data. Though the target heart rate is an “objective” part of the study because it is numerical, does not mean it is without bias. Heart rate calculations have historically ignored weight, height, average physical activity, and many other factors. This is just one example of how all of the data is biased, and cannot be placed into these categorizations. Additionally, the “data streams” figure of speech is a part of popular data discourse, contributing to the idea that data is a natural resource waiting to be found, untainted and untouched by human interference.\nDiscourse is the way that people talk about and engage with a certain thing/person, and dominant discourse can often characterize how we think about this topic as a society. The imagery of a data stream indicates that data is natural and is something we can “drink” from at any time. In reality, all data is collected from humans, who are limited in their standpoints and views."

    "text": "Units of Observation\n\nAny time we count something in the world, we are not only engaging in a process of tabulation; we are also engaged in a process of defining. If I count the number of students in a class, I first have to define what counts as a student. If someone is auditing the class, do they count? If I, as the instructor, am learning from my students, do I count myself as a student? As I make decisions about how I’m going to define “student,” those decisions impact the numbers that I produce. When I change my definition of “student,” how I go about tabulating students also changes. Thus, as we prepare to count observations in a dataset, it is important to know how those observations are defined.\n\n\nWhat does each row in your dataset represent?\nIn this dataset, each row is a _____.\n\n\nHow does that observation get defined in the data documentation?\n\nFind a definition for your unit of observation in the data documentation and cite it (with a citation) below.\n\nFill your response here.\n\n\nDevelop a timeline for this definition.\n\nDo some research on the agency website to determine when this definition was established and how it has changed over time. List key dates, along with what happened to the definition on those dates below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do social groups talk about this definition?\n\nSearch Google for the following: “what counts as a ______” Fill the blank with your unit of observation. For instance, if I was studying the National Bridge Inventory, I might type “what counts as a federal bridge”. Read through articles from multiple stakeholder perspectives (i.e. not just agencies). Can you identify any controversies or ambiguities about “what counts”? What are those controversies/ambiguities, and why did they emerge?\n\nFill your response here.\n\n\nWhat potentially relevant concerns are left out of the data due to the scope of this definition?\nFill your response here.\n\n\nThere are two sets of questions below - one set specific for categorical variables, and one set specific for numeric variables.

October 24, 2012. https://www.cnbc.com/2012/10/24/17-groups-petition-epa-for-public-reporting-of-chemical-releases-from-fracking-other-oil-and-gas-operations.html.\nThe Toxic Release Inventory is often portrayed as documenting “raw” information about the annual state of pollution in the US. The data is leveraged by journalists and activists to convey evidence of changing environmental health conditions in the US. While certain environmental advocates and activists celebrate the publication of this data as a form of governmental transparency and accountability, they also lament its failure to address particular environmental issues warranting public concern:\n\n“The Toxics Release Inventory brings daylight to dark corners by requiring companies to quantify and report their pollution to a public data base for everyone to see,” said Environmental Integrity Project Director Eric Schaeffer. “That makes it easier for communities to measure the environmental impact of local industries, motivates companies to reduce their emissions, and gives all of us insight into how well our environmental laws are working. The EPA estimates the oil and gas industry releases 127,000 tons of hazardous air pollutants every year, second only to power plants and more than any of the other industries already reporting to TRI. Why shouldn’t oil and gas companies be required to report these toxic releases under our Right-to-Know laws, like so many other industries already do?”\n\n“Dealing with Emissions and Waste Can Cost Businesses Multiple Millions.” 2018. AP NEWS. February 11, 2018. https://apnews.com/article/496364d1d8aa48c29bda249e1e1313ff.\nSo while the data is often cast in a revelatory way, it is also critiqued for its shortcomings. In such cases, the data’s “raw”-ness gets implicitly called into question as they fail to reveal a comprehensive state of environmental health conditions.\n\n\nQuote 1\nFill your response here.\n\n\nQuote 2\nFill your response here.\n\n\nQuote 3\nFill your response here."

Enter the name of your dataset in quotation marks (e.g. “National Bridge Inventory”) in the search bar. What kind of positions come up?\nSearch Google News for your dataset in quotation marks. What kinds of people are quoted in news articles about the dataset?\nSearch Twitter for your dataset in quotation marks. What kinds of people are tweeting about the dataset?\nCheck to see if there is an organization chart for the agency that runs the dataset. Can you figure out where the dataset is managed, and who runs that program?\n\nTwo important notes:\n\nYour list should be specific. You should provide more specificity than “data collectors” or “government agency employees” for instance. Try to identify who the data collectors are and what roles at which government agencies are implicated in the data collection.\nWhile you should be specific, you don’t need to list actual human names. You might list a person’s role (e.g. statistician at the EPA)\nBe careful not to confuse people with institutions. Congress, for instance, is an institution. Government is an institution.

    "text": "Course logo designed by Zoe Scheffler, Fall ’21\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout rich documentation, quantitative data can strip away critical context needed to interpret values responsibly. This course introduces students to the theory and practice of data ethnography, demonstrating how qualitative data collection and analysis can be brought to bear on the study of data settings and artifacts. Through experiential exercises, students will learn techniques in field-note writing, participant observation, in-depth interviewing, documentary analysis, and archival research and how they may be used to contextualize the cultural underpinnings of datasets. Students will learn how to visualize datasets in ways that foreground their socio-political provenance in R. Students will also learn how ethnographic methods can be leveraged to improve data documentation and communication. The course will introduce debates regarding the politics of techno-scientific fieldwork. Upon completion of this course, you should be able to:\n\nRecognize, interpret, and communicate the cultural underpinnings of data resources, infrastructures, and practices\nDefine and engage principal methods of ethnography and communicate when and how they may be used in the study of data\nStrategically apply relevant ethnographic methods to the study of a data setting or artifact\nProduce data documentation and visualizations that account for the cultural contexts of data production, categorization, measurement, and use\n\nClasses will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2:45 PM to 4:00 PM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsay Poirier, she/her/hers.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a cultural anthropologist that studies how civic data gets produced, how communities think about and interface with data, and how data infrastructure can be designed more equitably. My Ph.D. is in an interdisciplinary discipline called Science and Technology Studies - a field that studies the intricate ways science, technology, culture, and politics all co-constitute each other. I work on a number of collaborative research projects that leverage public data to deepen understanding of social and environmental inequities in the US, while also qualitatively studying the politics behind data gaps and inconsistencies. As an instructor, I prioritize active learning and often structure courses as flipped classrooms. You can expect in-class time to predominantly involve group activities and live problem-solving exercises.\n\n\n\nSlackMeeting with Me\n\n\nI can best support students in this course when I can readily keep tabs on our course-related communication. Because of this, I ask that you please don’t email me regarding course-related questions or issues. The best way to get in touch with me is via our course Slack. If you have course-related questions, I encourage you to ask them in the #sds-237-questions channel. When discretion is needed, feel free to DM. Please reserve more formal concerns like grades or accommodation requests for an in-person (or in-person virtual) conversation.\nDuring the week, I will try my best to answer all Slack messages within 24 hours of receiving them. Please note that to maintain my own work-life balance, I don’t answer Slack messages late in the evenings or on the weekends. It’s important that you plan when you start your assignments accordingly.\n\n\nMeeting with me outside of class is a great opportunity for us to chat about what you’re learning in the course, clarify expectations on assignments, and review work in progress. I also love when students drop in to office hours to request book recommendations, discuss career or research paths, or just to say hi!\nThere are two ways to meet with me. If you would like to have a one-on-one private conversation, I ask that you schedule an appointment with me via the booking form on Moodle. For support on class topics, you may drop-in during my regularly scheduled office hours.\n\nTuesday, 1:30PM-2:30PM, McConnell 214\nThursday, 4:15-5:15PM, McConnell 214\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will make all course readings available on Perusall, which can be accessed through our course Moodle page.\n\n\n\nThis course will be graded via a grading contract.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacobson Center\n\n\n\nSmith’s Jacobson Center asserts that all students can improve their communication and learning skills. I encourage all students to take advantage of their writing support services, workshops, and tutors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparationAttendanceExtensionsAcademic HonestyGenerative AI\n\n\nThis is a 4-credit course with 3 hours per week of in-classroom instructions. Smith expects students to devote 9 out-of-class hours per week to 4-credit classes. I have designed the course assignments and selected the course readings with this target in mind.\n\n\nBecause this course aims to hone certain critical thinking skills, much of the learning happens in class, in collaboration with peers. Attendance in class is both important for your own learning, and for your peers’ learning, as we will spend a good chunk of time in class engaging in group activities and discussions.\nAttendance will be taken each class period. That said, we all have reasons we can’t be available from time-to-time. You may miss three classes with no penalty. You do not need to inform me that you will be absent in these cases, but you should let your group members know. After the third unexcused absence, your grade may drop by a modifier for each class missed. I understand that you may need to be absent beyond these three sessions. Additional absences may be excused due to family/personal difficulties, sickness, or school or career-related activities; however, I will require some form of documentation for these absences. Please speak with your class dean or the Accessibility Resource Center so that we can get documentation of your need.\nI also ask that you make every effort to arrive to class on time. This is a large course, and when students arrive late, it can be distracting for me as the instructor, and it can be distracting to other students in the course. It also makes it difficult for me to plan group activities. Students arriving more than 10 minutes late for class without having informed me ahead of time will be marked as absent.\nIf you must miss a class entirely, you should contact a peer to discuss what was missed. Please note that the SDS Program has adopted a shared policy regarding in-person attendance:\n\nIn keeping with Smith’s core identity and mission as an in-person, residential college, SDS affirms College policy (as per the Provost and Dean of the College) that students will attend class in person. SDS courses will not provide options for remote attendance. Students who have been determined to require a remote attendance accommodation by the Accessibility Resource Center will be the only exceptions to this policy. As with any other kind of ADA accommodations, please notify your instructor during the first week of classes to discuss how we can meet your accommodations.\n\n\n\nThis course aims to support you in learning to become more perceptive to data environments surrounding you. Because of this I’ve deliberately spread course assignments out over the semester in order to help you gain practice in consistently paying attention to these environments. This critical mode of thinking can’t be cultivated effectively if the work is being crammed into later parts of the semester. Further, because this course emphasizes student growth over achievement, I also want to ensure that I can provide feedback on your writing in time for you to incorporate it into future assignments.\nThere is a 24-hour grace period on all written assignments. There will be no penalties for submitting the written assignment within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any written assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted.\nNote that this policy does not apply to reading assignments/Perusall annotations. Reading assignments/Perusall annotations need to be completed by the due date for credit.\n\n\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Any cases of dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:\n\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as chatGPT\n\n\n\nThe use of generative artificial intelligence tools is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in a number of domains of work. Despite the urge to push forward with this innovative technology, there are both pedagogical and social reasons that I do not allow students to use generative AI in the context of this course.\nThis course aims to facilitate the development of your ability to think critically and express your ideas with care. The depth of your learning in this course cannot be assessed if Generative AI is aiding or doing this work for you. This course also encourages reflexivity - i.e. I will ask you often throughout the semester to reflect on and communicate your personal standpoint and how it impacts the way you write about cultural phenomenon. Since many generative AI algorithms act as “black boxes” (i.e. we don’t fully know what data they were trained on and how they operate internally) it’s not possible to be fully account for the standpoint from which generative AI text was generated.\nFurther, there are countless unresolved social concerns that stem from the use of generative AI - from the loss of cultural heritage, to the limiting of human aspirations and viewpoints, to the lack of formal mechanisms for regulating its potential social harms. Generative AI models often undermine scholarly values of credit by training on data harvested from across the internet that content creators have not provided express permission to use for these purposes. As an example, several academic journal articles that I have written were recently sold to Microsoft AI; I did not have an opportunity to opt out of this, and I will not receive any compensation for my contributions. Copyright laws have not been able to keep pace with the technology. This course will teach you how to interrogate how these kinds of social harms can emerge from data-based systems and imagine opportunities for mitigating them; the course itself suggests taking a precautionary approach in the absence of regulation and other safeguards.\nAccordingly, any use of generative artificial intelligence in this course will be considered a case of academic dishonesty/plagiarism and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of ConductPrinciples of CommunityPronouns\n\n\nAs the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack.\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nI hope that we can foster a collaborative and caring environment in this classroom: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities. Here are some ideas that I have for creating this environment in our course:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work. “What three words describe how you’re feeling?” “Name one challenge and one success from this week.” “What are you doing for self-care right now?” Thank each other for sharing where they’re at.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge that there is much we don’t know about how our colleagues experience the world. …but don’t ask colleagues to speak on behalf of a social group you perceive them to be a part of.\nCheer on colleagues as they give presentations or try something out for the first time.\nAsk questions often in our #sds-237-questions channel. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nMistakes happen. I will certainly make mistakes in class. Admit mistakes, and then move on.\n\n\n\nUsing the proper pronouns for our students is foundational to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a culture of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodationsStudent Well-beingTrigger Warnings\n\n\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact Accessibility Resource Center in College Hall 104 or at arc@smith.edu. The Center will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ARC, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center. I can point you to these resources at any time throughout the semester.\n\n\nA trigger is a topic or image that can precipitate an intense emotional response. When common triggering topics are to be covered in this course, I will do my best to provide a trigger warning in advance of the discussion. However, I can’t always anticipate triggers. With this in mind I’ve set up an anonymous form, available on Moodle, where you can indicate topics for which you would like me to provide a warning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoodlePerusallGoogle DriveSlack\n\n\nGrades, forms, and handouts will be available on the course Moodle.\n\n\nAll course readings and recorded lectures will be available on Perusall. You can access Perusall via our course Moodle page.\n\n\nThis semester, you will submit all of your assignments in a Google Drive folder that you will create on the first day of class. You can write your assignments in Google Docs, or you can work on your own computer and upload files to Google Drive. I just need to be able to open the files on my computer.\n\n\nOutside of class almost all of our communication will happen via Slack. You can use the following channels\n\n#general: Course announcements (only I can post)\n#sds-237-discussions: Share news articles and relevant opportunities\n#sds-237-questions: Ask and answer questions about our course\n#sds-237-class-notes: Find notes that a designated student took for our class on a given day\nYou can also create private Slack channels with your project group members."

If you receive an 80% or better on that quiz, it can replace one of your reading annotation assignments. If you receive a 100% on that quiz, it can replace two of your reading annotation assignments.\n\n\n\nDeadlines\nAssignments are due before class (2:45PM EST) on the designated due date. Any granted extensions are similarly due before 2:45PM EST on the date the deadline is extended to.\n\n\nEarning an A\nYou’ll notice that, in most categories, there’s no difference in the quantity of labor you need to complete to earn an A vs. a B. Earning a B in this course demonstrates that you have completed enough work to meet the course’s learning goals. An A grade in this course indicates that you have exceeded expectations of the course’s learning goals. Please note that this does not mean that you need to do more labor (i.e. more assignments) to earn A. Instead, you need to consistently demonstrate levels of critical thinking on existing course assignments that surpass the minimum requirements.\nTo earn an A in this course, you will need to complete 3 course assignments at an advanced level. You will select the assignments that you want to complete at this level from the labor log, giving you an opportunity to choose where you want to engage deeper. The following chart helps breakdown some of the differences between meeting expectations and exceeding expectations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting Expectations\nExceeding Expectations\n\n\n\n\nDefining and applying course concepts\nDrawing connections between course concepts, critiquing them, or extending them (i.e. offering new ways to think about them)\n\n\nCiting arguments from a course reading to support interpretation and ethnographic arguments\nEngaging more deeply with a course reading - unpacking how its arguments are supported and evaluating its relevance when applied to other ethnographic data\n\n\nImplementing an ethnographic research method\nDefending the selection of a research method and evaluating its strengths/limitations\n\n\nWriting up research findings to convey an argument\nExperimenting with the prose and form of argumentative writing with a clear analytic purpose\n\n\nReporting ethnographic findings in writing\nCritically situating the standpoints of your research findings throughout the writing\n\n\nAnalyzing how a social force shapes the constitution of data\nAnalyzing how multiple, at times competing, social forces shape the constitution of data\n\n\nClearly communicating the contexts that produced data in a format appropriate for a given audience\nCreatively playing with the style and medium of communication in order to better reach and engage an audience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that you may complete a reading annotation assignment at an advanced level by signing up to lead a 15-minute classroom discussion of that reading. I will remind you of this option throughout the first few weeks of the course. This is the only option for completing reading annotation assignments at an advanced level.\n\n\nThe labor log designates which assignments you may attempt to complete at an advanced level. You will be asked to justify why you consider your work on the assignment as advanced in the labor log. Please note that, when justifying why I should consider the work advanced in the labor log, you should clearly explain how the cognitive effort on the assignment surpasses minimum expectations. While you may end up writing more or spending more time on these assignments, exceeding the minimum word count or spending x hours on the assignment would not be considered adequate justification for advanced level work. Being able to justify why your work is advanced demonstrates to me that you have gained a deep understanding of the course’s learning objectives and that you have the ability to communicate what you’ve learned. While it is ultimately up to you to determine what constitutes advanced level work, I am happy to brainstorm ideas with you in office hours.\nPlease note that I reserve the right to deny advanced level designations after reviewing your work, and I also reserve the right to deem an assignment as having been completed at an advanced level, even when you haven’t designated it as such. If ultimately I deny a designation, you may attempt to earn the advanced level designation again. Note that this is a good reason not to wait until the end of the semester to attempt advanced level work.\nAttendance/late arrivals also separate A grades from B grades. Keep in mind that the final grade will be reduced by one grade modifier for each unexcused absence/late arrival beyond the number allowed for your contracted grade. This means that if you completed the work for an A, and you have 4 absences, the final grade will be an A-, and with 5 absences, it would be a B+. I chose to use grade modifiers here so that if you miss just one class beyond the first 3 allotted (i.e. 4 absences), it doesn’t drop your grade so drastically from an A to a B."

    "title": "SDS 237: Data Ethnography",
    "section": "FAQ",
    "text": "FAQ\n\nWhat kind of feedback will I receive regarding my work?\nYou will receive extensive and timely feedback on all of your submissions (from me and from your colleagues), and you will have opportunities to revise. I will also provide rubrics for most assignments to indicate how I will evaluate your work. However, you will not receive points or an A, B, C, D, etc. on individual assignments.\n\n\nThere appear to be a significant number of assignments and deadlines in this course. Why is this the case?\nI’ve been very deliberate in pacing your assignments for this course for a number of reasons. Developing the critical thinking skills required of ethnography demands building and consistently practicing observational habits. I want you to leave this class being more mindful of the cultural forces shaping the numbers you see everyday. You are being asked to complete several short reflective writing assignments for this course so that you can start to build those habits. I am aware that this will mean that, sometimes, the writing you produce for this course will not be the very best quality you can produce. Especially for the field note assignments, I have prioritized consistency over depth of reflection because the primary goal there is to encourage you to become more habitually observant. This is also why you have the opportunity to select assignments you want to invest more time on when aiming for an A. If you are struggling with this course’s workload, I recommend coming to talk with me in office hours.\n\n\nHow can I best keep track of my labor in this course?\nThroughout the semester, you will be asked to keep track of your labor via a log that you will share with me. I will reference this log to calculate certain aspects of your final grade. Instructions for using the labor log will be provided in the second week of the course.\n\n\nCan I earn +/- grades in this course?\n+/- will be assigned to final grades at my discretion in cases where a student’s work consistently exceeds the expectations (+) of their contracted grade or is in some way insufficient (-). Students can track their progress towards a grade modifier in feedback that I provide throughout the semester. Your grade may also be reduced by a grade modifier for each missed class beyond the number associated with your contracted grade.\n\n\nWhat if I need an extension on an assignment?\nThere is a 24-hour grace period on all written assignments, except for reading annotations. There will be no penalties for submitting the written assignment within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any written assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted.\n\n\nCan I ask for extensions or use the grace period for reading annotations?\nReading assignments/Perusall annotations prepare you to participate in class discussions. For this reason, they need to be completed by the due date for credit. I’ve provided considerable leeway to miss a reading annotation assignment from time-to-time in order to accommodate flexibility in this regard.\n\n\nWhat if I don’t know how to complete an assignment at an advanced level?\nIf you are not sure how to complete assignments at an advanced level, you should plan to come talk with me in office hours. I’m more than happy to help you brainstorm ideas!\n\n\nAn assignment deadline is approaching, and I’m unhappy with the quality of my work. What should I do?\nWhile I always encourage students to strive to submit the best work they can, this course’s grading contract, coupled with the course’s revision assignments, permits you to submit work that you know you want to continue to improve upon without penalty. Not submitting assignments at all has the potentially to significantly lower your grade in this course, whereas submitting an assignment that could benefit from more revision will not be detrimental to your grade as long as the minimum submission requirements are met."

Students leading a discussion should start by taking 2-3 minutes to summarize the main arguments of the reading, dicussing how the author supports those arguments. After this, it is up to the student(s) presenting how they wish to structure the remaining time. I’ve had students pose discussion questions to the whole class. I’ve also had students pose questions for small groups to discuss first (note that if you take this option, there is really only time to discuss at most 2 questions; trust me, the time goes by fast). I’ve also had students do more experimental things like create Kahoots or present case studies for the class to think through. It’s up to you! Just get us reflecting on the reading! Often students create slides to help structure the discussion, but this is not necessarily a requirement."

This data was first published in 2015 and since has undergone several improvements and revisions.\nThe College Scorecard dataset is massive. In fact, I thought long and hard about whether this was really the first dataset I wanted to introduce to you in a lab. It includes information about over 6500 institutions in the U.S., and has more than 3000 columns documenting information about those institutions. I chose this dataset for this lab because, if you can learn to read this data dictionary, you will be leaps and bounds ahead of the game in learning to read other data dictionaries. (It’s also just a super cool dataset, and hint, hint: you will get a chance to dive into it in much more detail in a few weeks). While the full data is available online, we are only going to work with a small subset of the data today."

    "section": "Getting to Know this Dataset",
    "text": "Getting to Know this Dataset\n\nObservations (Rows)\nIn starting our data analysis, we need to have a good sense of what each observation in our dataset refers to - or its observational unit. Think of it this way. If you were to count the number rows in your dataset, what would that number refer to? A unique key is a variable (or set of variables) that uniquely identifies an observation in the dataset. Think of a unique key as a unique way to identify a row and all of the values in it. There should never be more than one row in the dataset with the same unique key. A unique key tells us what each row in the dataset refers to.\n\nQuestion\n\nSee if you can identify a unique key for this dataset. Write some lines of code to determine whether the column you’ve identified can act as unique key for the data. Hint: You need to check whether the values in the column ever repeat.\n\n\n# Write code to calculate number of rows in scorecard\n\n# Write code to calculate the number of unique values in the column you've identified as a unique key \n\n# Do these numbers match?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy not use name as a unique key?\n\n\n\nNote that NAME is typically not an appropriate variable to use as a unique key. Let me provide an example to demonstrate this. When I worked for BetaNYC, I was trying to build a map of vacant storefronts in NYC by mapping all commercially zoned properties in the city, and then filtering out those properties where a business was licensed or permitted. This way the map would only include properties where there wasn’t a business operating. One set of businesses I was filtering out was restaurants. The only dataset that the city had made publicly available for restaurant permits was broken. It was operating on an automated process to update whenever there was a change in the permit; however, whenever a permit was updated, rather than updating the appropriate fields in the existing dataset, it was creating a new row in the dataset that only included the permit holder (the restaurant name), the permit type, and the updated fields. Notably the unique permit ID was not being included in this new row. We pointed this issue out to city officials, but fixing something like this can be slow and time-consuming, so in the meantime, we looked into whether we could clean the data ourselves by aggregating the rows that referred to the same restaurant. However, without the permit ID it was impossible to uniquely identify the restaurants in the dataset. Sure, we had the restaurant name, but do you know how many Wendy’s there are in NYC?\n\n\nAnytime we count something in the world, we are not only engaging in a process of tabulation; we are also engaging in a process of defining. If I count the number of students in a class, I first have to define what counts as a student. If someone is auditing the class, do they count? If I, as the instructor, am learning from my students, do I count myself as a student? As I make decisions about how I’m going to define “student,” those decisions impact the numbers that I produce. When I change my definition of “student,” how I go about tabulating students also changes. Thus, as we prepare to count observations in a dataset, it is important to know how those observations are defined.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nAt this point, you’ve probably figured out that each row in this dataset is a higher education institution. …but there are many different ways that we can define higher education institutions, and that will impact what gets included and excluded in our data. Referencing the Technical Documentation, locate a definition for the unit of observation in this dataset. What institutions are included, and what institutions are excluded? Summarize a definition below.\n\n\n\n\nVariables (Columns)\nNote the column names for this dataframe, and the kinds of values that appear in those columns. Some of them (like city and year) might make sense to you immediately. Others (like pcip27 and highdeg) might be much more confusing. To figure out what we are looking out, we are going to need to refer to the dataset’s data dictionary.\nOpen the data dictionary you downloaded in an earlier step. It will open as an Excel file. Click on the tab labeled “Institution_Data_Dictionary”. There are thousands of variables in this dataset, falling into the broader categories of school, completion, admissions, cost, etc. Note how the file is organized, and specifically draw your attention to:\n\nColumn 1 (NAME OF DATA ELEMENT): This is a long description of the variable and gives you clues as to what is represented in it.\nColumn 6 (VARIABLE NAME): This is the column name for the variable. This is how you will reference the variable in R.\nColumn 7 (VALUE): These are the possible values for that variable. Note that for many categorical variables, the values are numbers. We are going to have to associate the numbers with their corresponding labels.\nColumn 8 (LABEL): These are the labels associated with the values recorded for the variable.\nColumn 11 (NOTES): This provides notes about the variable, including whether it is currently in use and what missing values indicate.\n\n\nQuestion\n\nFor each of the variable names in the scorecard data frame, look up the associated name in the data dictionary. You will need to search for the variable name in the sixth column of the data dictionary (I recommend using Ctrl-F to quickly locate the variable name in the spreadsheet.) Once you’ve found the variable name, reference column 1 to determine what this variable means, and reference columns 7 and 8 to see what possible values will appear in that column.\nIdentify one nominal variable, one ordinal variable, one discrete variable, and one continuous variable in scorecard and list their variable names below. Then uncomment the lines below and use the typeof() function to see how R determined their data types. Did any surprise you?\n\n\n#typeof(scorecard$_____)\n#typeof(scorecard$_____)\n#typeof(scorecard$_____)\n#typeof(scorecard$_____)\n\n\n\n\nValues (Cells)\nYou may have noticed that several categorical variables are coded as numbers in the imported dataset. For instance, look at the column control which designates the institution’s ownership. Running the code below, we see that the distinct values in that column are 1, 2, and 3.\n\nunique(scorecard$control)\n\n[1] 2 1 3\n\n\nWhen we reference that column in the data dictionary (row 27), we see that a 1 in that column designates that the institution is Public, a 2 that the institution is Private nonprofit, and a 3 that the institution is Private for-profit. While I can always look that up, sometimes it is helpful to have that information in our dataset. For instance, let’s say I create a bar plot that’s supposed to show how many higher education institutions have each type of ownership in MA (which you will learn how to do soon!). The plot can be confusing when control is a series of numbers.\n\nggplot(scorecard, aes(x = control)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this in mind, sometimes it can be helpful to recode the values in a column. Recoding data involves replacing the values in a vector according to criteria that we provide. Remember how all columns in a data frame are technically vectors? We can use the recode() function to recode all of the values in the control vector. We are going to store the recoded values in a new column in our dataset called control_text. Check out the code below to see how we do this. Reference the help pages for recode (i.e. ?recode) to help you interpret the code.\n\nscorecard$control_text &lt;-\n  recode(\n    scorecard$control, \n    \"1\" = \"Public\", \n    \"2\" = \"Private nonprofit\", \n    \"3\" = \"Private for-profit\",\n    .default = NA_character_\n  )\n\nCheck out our barplot now!\n\nggplot(scorecard, aes(x = control_text)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nWrite code below to recode the admcon7 variable and store the results in a new variable in scorecard called admcon7_text. You’ll need to look up the values in the data dictionary. If you’ve done this correctly, running this code should produce a barplot that displays multiple bars.\n\n\nscorecard$admcon7_text &lt;-\n  recode(\n    scorecard$admcon7, \n    #Fill replacements here\n    .default = NA_character_\n  )\n\nggplot(scorecard, aes(x = admcon7_text)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\nMissing Values\nWhen we have missing values in a rectangular dataset, we have to provide a placeholder for the missing value in order for the dataset to remain rectangular. If we just skipped the value, then our dataset wouldn’t necessarily have rows of all equal lengths and columns of all equal lengths. In R, NA serves as that placeholder. Before we start analyzing data, it can be important to note how many NA values we have in a column so that we can determine if the data is representative.\nThe function is.na() checks whether a value is an NA value and returns TRUE if it is and FALSE if it isn’t. Providing a vector to is.na() will check this for every value in the vector and return a logical vector indicating TRUE/FALSE for every original value in the vector.\n\nis.na(scorecard$wdraw_orig_yr2_rt)\n\n  [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n [16] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n [31] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n [46] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n [61] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n [76] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n [91] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n[106] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n[121] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n[136] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n\n\nWhen we sum() across a logical vector, R will calculate the number of TRUE values in the vector.\n\nsum(is.na(scorecard$wdraw_orig_yr2_rt))\n\n[1] 147\n\n# Note that this is the same as:\n\nscorecard$wdraw_orig_yr2_rt |&gt; is.na() |&gt; sum()\n\n[1] 147\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nIn a code chunk below, calculate the number of missing values in both the costt4_a and the costt4_p columns. Reference the NOTES column in the data dictionary to determine why there are so many NA values in these columns. Add a comment to the code chunk below, explaining the reason for missing values in these columns.\n\n\n# Write code here\n\n# Add comment here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthical Considerations\n\n\n\nReferencing the College Scorecard data documentation, see if you can determine which students are included in calculations of earnings and debt. How might the data’s coverage bias the values that get reported? What might be the social consequences of these biases? Share your ideas on our sds-192-discussions Slack channel."

However, you may wish to refer back to this lab if you are looking fore resources to get help in R. This lab will introduce you to resources and techniques for problem solving in R. You should reference this lab often throughout the semester for reminders on best practices for addressing errors and getting help.\n\nProblem Solving Lab Instructions\nTemplate\n\n\n\nLab 1: Understanding Datasets\nThis lab is all about learning to understand the context and parts of a dataset by referencing and interpreting data dictionaries and technical data documentation. We will get to know the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard data, which includes over 3000 variables characterizing colleges in the U.S.\n\nLab 1 Instructions\nTemplate\n\n\n\nLab 2: Visualization Aesthetics\nThis week we will practice mapping variables in the U.S. National Bridge Inventory onto different plot aesthetics in order to tell different stories with the data. We’re going to look at what kinds of variables might contribute to poor bridge conditions, where there are poor bridge conditions, and which entities are responsible for maintaining them. We will only be creating one type of plot today - a scatterplot. However, we are going to show how we can use different visual cues to plot a number of different variables onto a scatterplot.\n\nLab 2 Instructions\nTemplate\n\n\n\nLab 3: Plotting Freqencies\nIn this lab, you will practice plotting both frequencies and distributions by analyzing data about racial disparities in home mortgage denial rates in Mississippi in 2024.\n\nLab 3 Instructions\nTemplate\n\n\n\nLab 4: GitHub\nThis lab is designed to help you get acquainted with the concepts behind Git and GitHub, suggested workflows for collaborating on projects in this course, and error resolution strategies.\n\nLab 4 Instructions\n\n\n\nLab 5: Data Wrangling\nIn this lab, you will apply 6 data wrangling verbs in order to analyze data regarding NYPD stop, question, and frisk. Specifically, we will replicate data analysis performed by the NYCLU in 2011 to demonstrate how the practice was being carried out unconstitutionally in New York.\n\nLab 5 Instructions\nTemplate\n\n\n\nLab 6: Joining Datasets\nIn terms of data analysis, this lab has one goal: to determine the number of industrial facilities that are currently in violation of both the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act in California. To achieve this goal, we’re going to have to do some data wrangling and join together some datasets published by the EPA. We’re going to practice applying different types of joins to this data and consider what we learn with each.\n\nLab 6 Instructions\nTemplate\n\n\n\nLab 7: Tidying Datasets\nIn this lab, we will create a few data visualizations documenting point-in-time counts of homelessness in the United States. Specifically, we are going visualize data collected in 2020 through various Continuums of Care (CoCs) programs. In order to produce these data visualizations, you will need to join homelessness data with census population data and develop and execute a plan for how to wrangle the dataset into a “tidy” format.\n\nLab 7 Instructions\nTemplate\n\n\n\nLab 8: Programming with Data\nIn this lab, we will program some custom R functions that allow us to analyze data related to medical conflicts of interest. Specifically, we will determine which ten Massachusetts-based doctors received the most money from pharmaceutical or medical device manufacturers in 2021. Then we will leverage our custom functions to produce a number of tables and plots documenting information about the payments made to each of these doctors. In doing so, we will update a similar analysis produced by ProPublica in 2018 called Dollars for Docs.\n\nLab 8 Instructions\nTemplate\n\n\n\nLab 9: Mapping with Leaflet\nIn this lab, we will build a map that visualizes unaddressed housing violations in NYC in order to identify some of the city’s worst landlords. In doing so, we will gain practice in producing point maps in Leaflet. This analysis is based off of a similar analysis conducted by the NYC Public Advocate’s Office.\n\nLab 9 Instructions\nTemplate\n\n\n\nLab 10: Working with APIs\nIn this lab, we will write queries to access subsets of a very large dataset on the NYC Open Data Portal. We will practice all of the standards we have learned in the course so far in visualizing and wrangling the resulting data.\n\nLab 10 Instructions\n[Template](https://github.com/SDS-192-Intro/public-website-fall-25/blob/main/_templates/lab10.qmd"

This law was put into place to promote transparency in our medical system - enabling the U.S. government and citizens to monitor for potential medical conflicts of interest.\nToday, every time a drug or medical device manufacturer makes a payment to a covered recipient, they must disclose the nature of that payment and the amount to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid. Data about payments is then aggregated, reviewed by (and sometimes disputed by) recipients, corrected, and then published as an open government dataset.\nDefinitions for what counts as a reporting entity, a covered recipient, and a reportable activity have been expanding since the passing of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act as legislators have raised concerns over the degree of transparency of diversifying financial arrangements in the healthcare system. In 2020, the first settlement for violations to the Sunshine Act was announced, requiring Medtronic Inc. to pay $9.2 million to resolve allegations for failure to report. This served as a signal that enforcement is ramping up in the coming years. In 2022, the state of California passed a law requiring that medical practitioners disclose to patients that this data resource exists."

    "text": "Cleaning up this Data Frame\nEventually we are going to plot some timelines of payments to specific doctors, and we will need the date_of_payment column to be in a date-time format to do so. Right now however, these columns are strings. To get started with cleaning up this dataset, let’s convert the date columns in open_payments_original to a date-time format.\n\nQuestion\n\nWrite code to convert the date_of_payment and the payment_publication_date column to date-time format. You should first determine the format of the date in date_of_payment and payment_publication_date and then reference the lubridate to determine the corresponding function for parsing that date format. Finally, you will mutate the two columns.\n\nOptional challenge: Rather than mutating each column, see if you can mutate() across() the two columns to complete this step.\n\n\n\n# Uncomment below to write code to convert to date-time format here. \n\n# open_payments_dates_cleaned &lt;- open_payments_original |&gt;\n\n\n\nTo confirm that we’ve done this right, we can check whether both of the dates are in the date-time format.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nThe is.Date function returns TRUE if a vector is in date-time format, and FALSE if it is not. Below, I’ve selected the two columns in open_payments that contain the word “date” in the column header. Determine which map() function to use in order to return a vector that indicates whether these columns are in a date-time format. If you’ve done everything correctly, you should get the output below.\n\n\n# Select the appropriate map function below\n\nopen_payments_dates_cleaned |&gt;\n  select(contains(\"date\")) |&gt;\n  _____(is.Date)\n\n\n\n         date_of_payment payment_publication_date \n                    TRUE                     TRUE \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCheck out what happens if you swap out your map function above for map, map_chr, or map_int. Can you figure out the relationship between these values and the original values?\n\n\nIt’s important to note that the unit of observation in this dataset is not one medical practitioner, and it is not one manufacturer. Instead it is one payment from a manufacturer to a medical practitioner. That means that a medical practitioner can appear multiple times in the dataset if they’ve received multiple payments, and a medical drug or device manufacturer can appear multiple times in the dataset if they’ve disbursed multiple payments. We can identify medical practitioners with the covered_recipient_npi column and manufacturers with the applicable_manufacturer_or_applicable_gpo_making_payment_id column.\n…but we want to know more than just the ID of a medical practitioner. To identify which doctors are receiving the most money, we also want to know that practitioner’s name, location, specialty, etc. Because practitioners’ names are manually entered into a database every time a payment is made to them, sometimes the formatting of a practitioner’s name entered for one payment can differ from how that same practitioner’s name is formatted when entered for another payment. The same goes for other variables related to that practitioner. For instance, check out how the capitalization differs for the practitioner below. In some cases, there is a middle initial, while in others, there is a full middle name; in some cases, the practitioner’s name is all capitalized, and in other cases it is not.\n\nopen_payments_dates_cleaned |&gt;\n  filter(covered_recipient_npi == 1003040676) |&gt;\n  select(covered_recipient_first_name, covered_recipient_middle_name, covered_recipient_last_name)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis issue with formatting exists across this entire dataset. To ensure that similar entities appear in the right buckets when we aggregate the data, we are going to standardize capitalization across the whole dataset. We’re also going to leave out the practitioner’s middle initial since it is not always included (or included in the same way).\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nWrite code to mutate across all character columns such that strings in these columns are converted to title case. Title case refers to casing where the first letter in each word is capitalized and all other letters are lowercase. Strings can be converted to title case with the function str_to_title.\nAfter you’ve done this, mutate a new column called covered_recipient_full_name that concatenates (hint: i.e. paste()) together covered_recipient_first_name and covered_recipient_last_name.\nStore the resulting data frame in open_payments.\n\n\n# Uncomment below to clean up strings\n\n# open_payments &lt;- open_payments_dates_cleaned |&gt;\n\n\n\nAs we saw before, one covered_recipient_npi was associated with multiple names if the names were capitalized in some cases and not others. Now that we’ve standardized the formatting of these names, there ideally should be one full name associated with every covered_recipient_npi. Let’s compare the length of unique covered_recipient_npi values to the length of unique covered_recipient_full_name values to check whether this is the case.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nWrite a function below called num_unique. The function should calculate the length of unique values in the vector passed to the argument x.\nBelow, I’ve selected the two columns in open_payments that we want to iterate this function over. Determine which map() function to use in order to return a numeric vector that indicates the length of unique values in each of these columns. If you’ve done everything correctly, you should get the output below.\n\n\nnum_unique &lt;- function(x) {\n # Write function here.\n}\n\nopen_payments |&gt;\n  select(covered_recipient_npi, covered_recipient_full_name) |&gt;\n  _____(_____) # Determine which map function to call here.\n\n\n\n      covered_recipient_npi covered_recipient_full_name \n                      11837                       11858 \n\n\n\n\nNotice that there are still more full names than covered_recipient_npis, which means that certain doctors have multiple names in this dataset. Below I’ve written some code to calculate the number unique full names listed for each covered_recipient_npi and filter to the rows with more than one name. Can you identify some reasons why we might have multiple names listed for this same medical practitioner in this data frame?\n\nopen_payments |&gt;\n  group_by(covered_recipient_npi) |&gt;\n  mutate(num_names = length(unique(covered_recipient_full_name))) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  filter(num_names &gt; 1) |&gt;\n  select(covered_recipient_npi, covered_recipient_full_name) |&gt;\n  distinct() |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(covered_recipient_npi))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nBecause of these issues, it is important that we use the covered_recipient_npi to identify doctors vs. the full name.\nNow that we have a final cleaned up open_payments data frame, let’s remove the other data frames from our environment.\n\nrm(open_payments_original, open_payments_dates_cleaned)\n\n…and on to analysis."

Your final data frame should have 10 rows and columns for covered_recipient_npi and sum_total_payments.\n\n\n# Uncomment below and write data wrangling code\n\n#top_10_doctors &lt;- open_payments |&gt;\n\n\n\nRight now the values that we will eventually want to iterate over in our analysis are stored as columns in a dataframe. …but remember that the family of purrr functions allows us to apply a function to each element of a vector or list. We want to create a series of vectors from these columns that we can iterate over. We will use the pull() function to do this.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCreate a vector of top_10_doctors_ids from top_10_doctors, using the pull() function.\n\n\n# Uncomment and write code below to pull the top 10 doctor IDs into a vector\n\n# top_10_doctors_ids &lt;- top_10_doctors |&gt;\n\n\n\nWe also want a vector of doctor names associated with each of these IDs, but remember that there can be multiple names for a single doctor in this dataset. With this in mind, we are going to create a vector of the first listed name for a given covered_recipient_npi in the dataset. Taking the first listed name as the doctor’s name is an imperfect solution. The first listed name could be a misspelling. It could be a doctor’s maiden name that they have since changed. This is a temporary solution, and we would want to confirm that we have the correct name for each doctor before publishing any of these findings.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCreate a vector containing the names of the doctors associated with the IDs in top_10_doctors_ids. First, define the function get_doctor_name. This function will:\n\ntake a doctor_id as an argument,\nfilter open_payments to that ID,\nsummarize the first() covered_recipient_full_name listed for that ID,\npull() the name value\n\nOnce this function has been defined, select the appropriate map() function to iterate top_10_doctors_ids through get_doctor_name and store the resulting character vector in top_10_doctors_names.\n\n\nget_doctor_name &lt;- function(doctor_id){\n  # Write function code here\n}\n\n# Iterate the top_10_doctors_ids vector through get_doctor_name and store the results in a character vector\n\n# top_10_doctors_names &lt;- \n\n\n\n\nNow that we have the vectors we want to iterate over, we are ready to start defining our first functions.\n\n\nWhat kind of payments did MA-based doctors receive in 2021?\nTo get started, let’s define a function that filters open_payments to a given doctor ID, and then calculates how much of each kind of payment has been paid to that doctor. Here is an example of what that data wrangling code would look like for a specific covered_recipient_npi:\n\nopen_payments |&gt;\n  filter(covered_recipient_npi == 1194763482) |&gt;\n  group_by(nature_of_payment_or_transfer_of_value) |&gt;\n  summarize(num_payments = \n              sum(number_of_payments_included_in_total_amount),\n            total_payments = sum(total_amount_of_payment_usdollars))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nWrap the above code in a function named calculate_payment_type_amts. Rather than filtering to 1194763482, filter based on the value passed to an argument named doctor_id.\nThen, use the map() function to apply calculate_payment_type_amts to each element in the top_10_doctors_ids vector. Running this code should return a list of 10 data frames.\nFinally, pipe in set_names(top_10_doctors_names) to set the names for each data frame in the list to the doctor’s name.\n\n\n# Write calculate_payment_type_amts function here\n\n# Iterate calculate_payment_type_amts over top_10_doctors_ids and set names to top_10_doctors_names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen were payments made to each of these doctors in 2021?\nHere’s an example of a plot we could create to answer this question for one doctor.\n\n  open_payments |&gt;\n    filter(covered_recipient_npi == 1194763482) |&gt;\n    ggplot(aes(x = day(date_of_payment), \n               y = \"\", \n               fill = total_amount_of_payment_usdollars)) +\n    geom_jitter(pch = 21, size = 2, color = \"black\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    labs(title = \"David Friedman\", \n         y = \"\", \n         x = \"Day\",\n         fill = \"Payment Amount\") +\n    scale_y_discrete(limits = rev) +\n    scale_fill_distiller(palette = \"BuPu\", direction = 1, labels = scales::comma) +\n    facet_wrap(vars(month(date_of_payment, label = TRUE)), nrow = 4) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nWrite a function named payments_calendar. The function should:\n\nTake a doctor_id and doctor_name as arguments\nFilter open_payments to the doctor’s ID\nCreate payment calendar plot modeled after the one above.\nSet the title of the plot to the doctor’s name\n\nAfter you’ve written this function, select the appropriate map function to apply payments_calendar to each element in the top_10_doctors_ids vector and top_10_doctors_names vector.\n\nOptional Challenge: Extend your code to include the first listed specialty for each top 10 doctor as a subtitle in each plot.\n\n\n\n# Write payments_calendar function here\n\n# Iterate payments_calendar over top_10_doctors_ids and top_10_doctors_ids to create 10 plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich manufacturers paid MA-based doctors in 2021, and through what forms of payment?\nFinally, let’s define a function that filters open_payments to a given doctor ID and determines how much the doctor received in compensation from different manufacturers, along with the forms of payment from each manufacturer. To do so, we will need to aggregate the data by covered_recipient_npi, applicable_manufacturer_or_applicable_gpo_making_payment_name, and form_of_payment_or_transfer_of_value and calculate the total payments associated with each grouping.\n\nQuestion\n\nWrite a function named calculate_manufacturer_payments. The function should:\n\nTake a doctor_id as an argument\nFilter open_payments to that ID\nAggregate the filtered data by covered_recipient_npi, applicable_manufacturer_or_applicable_gpo_making_payment_name, and form_of_payment_or_transfer_of_value\nCalculate the total amount of payments for each grouping\nSort the resulting data frame in descending order by the total amount of payments.\n\nAfter you’ve written this function, use the map_df() function to apply calculate_manufacturer_payments to each element in the top_10_doctors_ids vector. Note how this returns one data frame rather than a list of 10 data frames.\nPlot your resulting data frame as a column plot, attempting (to the best of your ability) to match the formatting of the plot below.\n\nOptional Challenge: List the doctor’s full name in each facet band, rather than the the doctor’s ID.\n\n\n\n# Write calculate_manufacturer_payments function here\n\n# Iterate calculate_manufacturer_payments over top_10_doctors_ids here\n\n# Plot resulting data frame here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthical Considerations\n\n\n\nOn September 29, 2022, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill requiring that all physicians and surgeons notify patients about the Open Payments database on their initial visit. Specifically, patients will be given the following notice: “The Open Payments database is a federal tool used to search payments made by drug and device companies to physicians and teaching hospitals. It can be found at https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov,” and will be prompted to sign and date that they have received the notice. This policy was developed in response to concerns that, while the Open Payments database includes a great deal of information that might impact how citizens make decisions about their healthcare, very few people knew of the database. Do you think this is a good solution to this problem? Should other states follow suit? Do you see any drawbacks to this policy? Share your ideas on our sds-192-discussions Slack channel."

    "title": "Lab 4: Git and GitHub",
    "section": "GitHub Flow",
    "text": "GitHub Flow\n\ngit vs. GitHub.com\nAt the beginning of this semester, many of you installed git on your computers. git is a series of commands available in our computers to save snapshots of files at different moments in time. On the other hand, GitHub.com is a website where we can store projects that have been configured with git commands. As you’ve been accepting lab assignments for this course, project folders (what we will call repositories) have been created for you at GitHub.com. If you navigate to GitHub.com right now, you will see a list of these project folders, and you can click through each of the them to see changes that have been made. However, when you created projects for each of these repositories in RStudio, you were using git commands on your computer to copy the project from GitHub.com to your computer. Similarly, you were using git commands when you staged, committed, and pushed your changes back to GitHub.com. In sum, git is a series of command line tools to manage changes to files. GitHub.com is a Web hosting platform for storing git projects.\n\n\nRemote vs. Local\nWe can store, edit, and publish files on GitHub.com without ever copying them to our local computers. Files at GitHub.com are technically stored on a server somewhere, so we will refer to the projects stored at GitHub.com as remote (i.e. distant, far-off, etc). Similarly, we can use git commands to save snapshots of different versions of files on our local computers without ever pushing the changes to GitHub.com, so we will refer to the projects stored on on our computers as local. In this course, we need the ability to move changes to files between our local and remote repositories.\nWhy can’t we just do everything at GitHub.com or everything on our local machines?? Well GitHub.com doesn’t have the nice environment for writing and running code that you have in RStudio, so we need to be able to move things to your local computers so that you can work on the code in RStudio. On the other hand, if all the work was done on your local computer and never pushed to GitHub.com, I (your instructor) would never see it! So the first important consideration in the GitHub Flow is how do we move changes made on our local machines to GitHub.com and vice versa.\nThe great news is that you’ve already been doing this! The primary way that we move changes between remote and local is through two git commands: pull and push. Pull copies changes from a remote repository to our local machines. Push pushes changes from our local machines to a remote repository. It looks like this:\n\nTypically, we want to make sure that we always follow this flow:\n\nPull changes from GitHub.com (remote) to local.\nMake changes locally,\nPush changes to GitHub.com.\n\nAs we are going to see later in the lab, the most frustrating issues with GitHub emerge when we break this flow.\n\n\nTo Branch or Not to Branch?\nIn my opinion, there are two kinds of workflows for GitHub. There’s the quick and dirty version, and there’s the long and elegant version. We just went over the Quick and Dirty version, and you’ve already had practice in it when submitting all of your labs for the course. Below are the differences between these two workflows (don’t worry about if you don’t understand what the steps mean right now; we will learn all of them in the lab).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick and Dirty Version\nLong and Elegant Version\n\n\n\n\n\nPull recent changes from GitHub to local machine.\nMake edits and save them\nStage and commit changes.\nPush changes from local machine to GitHub.\n\nIn the quick and dirty version, all of this occurs in the main branch.\n\nCreate an issue at GitHub.com\nBranch the repo at GitHub.com.\nPull recent changes from GitHub.com to local machine.\nMake edits in the new branch and save them.\nStage and commit changes.\nPush changes from local machine to GitHub.com.\nCreate a pull request at GitHub.com\nAssign a reviewer to review the proposed changes and wait for their approval.\nMerge changes, while also closing the issue and deleting the branch.\n\n\n\n\nTypically I recommend the long and elegant version for group work as it is designed to avoid errors and ensure that collaborators are all on the same page regarding changes to files. However, occasionally when you have to make small, quick changes to a file, and it won’t impact your teammate’s work, it will make more sense to follow the quick and dirty workflow. The goal for today is to get practice in the long and elegant version.\n\n\nRepo\n\nQuestion\n\nNavigate to GitHub Classroom to accept the assignment. For this assignment, you will work with your Project 1 team members. You can find your group number at CATME.org.\n\n\n\nThis will create a repository at GitHub.com called github-practice. You’ll notice that the repository has a few files - README.md, github-practice.Rmd, .gitingore. You’ll also notice in the repo’s right sidebar that your group members are listed as collaborators. This means that you all have access to read and write to this repository.\n\n\n\n\nClone\nCloning is a git command that copies a remote repository to your local machine. In other words, it will copy all of the project files in the remote GitHub.com folder to your local computer.\n\nQuestion\n\nAll group members should clone the repo to their RStudio environment. To do so, copy the repo’s URL at GitHub.com. You will want to make sure you are in the main project folder when you copy this URL; it won’t work if you’ve clicked through to any of the files. Then in RStudio click on File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git, and paste the copied URL into the window that appears. Note what you see in the RStudio files pane after cloning the repo.\n\n\n\nRemember that cloning creates a copy of a remote repo on a local machine. In creating this project, you’ve copied all of the files that make up the github-practice repo at GitHub.com to your local computer. This means that you will find all of the files associated with this repo by navigating to the folder where you created the project on your computer.\nIt’s important to note that this is not just any old folder on your computer though. By cloning, you’ve created a git folder. This means that the folder has been set up in a way where git can track the changes that you make to it over time, and it knows that there is a remote version of the repository somewhere that you might want to keep it consistent with. If you tried to just create a new folder on your computer, it wouldn’t necessarily have these nice features.\n\n\n\n\nIssues\n\nQuestion\n\nNavigate back to GitHub.com, and click on the repo’s Issues tab. Each member of your team should create an issue by clicking the ‘New Issue’ button. Title the issue: “Adding &lt;your name&gt; to the assignment.” Submit the issue, and to the left of the screen, assign the issue to yourself.\n\n\n\n\nIssues support project planning by allowing you to track changes you hope to make to your project over time. By assigning issues to certain collaborators on your project team, you can have clear documentation of who is responsible for what.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn my own projects, I use Issues for a number of purposes. Sometimes I use Issues to bugs that I notice in my code that need to be fixed. Other times I use them to track features that I would like to add to my code down the road. Oftentimes, in my public repositories, I encourage others that are using my code to submit issues to ask questions about how something works, to report bugs, or to request features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch\nWhen you first create a repository, all of the code will be stored in the main branch of the repository. If you were to think of a project like a tree growing up from the ground, then the main branch would be the like the trunk of the tree. We don’t want the main branch to break because the whole tree could come down. One goal of a branching workflow in GitHub is to keep the most stable and polished versions of code in the main branch.\nSo what do we do in the meantime - when we’re editing code, potentially breaking things, trying to sort out its bugs, and it’s not quite in that stable and polished state yet? That’s where branching comes in.\nWhen we create a branch of our repo, GitHub creates a separate copy of the repo where you can make changes without impacting what’s in the main branch. Later, once we’re done making changes and things are stable and polished, we will have the opportunity to merge those changes back into the main branch.\nThink of it another way: You write a rockstar first draft of a final paper, and you decide to send it to a few friends to review. You could just share the original document with them and tell them “Have at it! Edit away!” The problem is that, if they are making changes directly to the original document, you could lose some of that awesome original text. A better option would be to create separate copies for each teammate to edit, send them those copies, and then figure out how to layer in their edits later. This is like branching. The original document would be the main branch, and each copy sent to a friend would be a branch off of main. Friends can make as many edits as they want in their branch because you still have the original stable and polished copy. Later, we can merge their changes back into the main branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBranching can get pretty wild in GitHub. You can have branches of branches of branches. I don’t recommend this. A good workflow is to create a branch for making specific changes, merge those changes back into main, delete the branch, and then create a new branch for the next batch of changes.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nClick on the Code tab on your repo’s page at GitHub.com. Directly below this tab, you will see a dropdown that is currently labeled “main.” This means that you are in the main branch. Each member of your team should click the down arrow, and create a branch by entering their first name into the textbox that appears, and then clicking “Create branch.”\n\n\n\n\n\nPull\nAs of right now, the branches that were created in the previous step only exist on GitHub.com, they don’t exist yet on your local machine. To get these changes to your local machine, you need to Pull the changes. Remember how we said that the super fancy git folder knows that there is a remote version of the repository somewhere that you might want to keep it consistent with? When we pull changes to our local machines, we are basically saying, check that remote version for changes, and then pull them into the repo on my computer.\n\nQuestion\n\nHead back to RStudio. In the Environment pane, you will notice a tab labeled “Git.” It’s important to note that this tab will only appear in projects that are built from super fancy git folders. This is your RStudio command center for Git and GitHub. When you click on this tab, you will see a few buttons in the navigation bar. To pull changes, you should click the blue downward arrow. Click this button to pull the branches created remotely to your local machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch Branches\nEven though you pulled the new branches to your local machine, you are still currently working in the main branch. Remember that we always want to keep the main branch stable and polished. This is not where we are going to make edits. Instead, you will make edits in the branch that you just created. Later, we will merge those changes back into the main branch.\n\nQuestion\n\nIn the top right hand corner of the Git tab, you will see a dropdown currently set to “main”. Click the downward arrow, and switch to your branch by selecting the appropriate branch.\n\n\n\n\n\nMake Changes\n\nQuestion\n\nOnce in your branch, open github-practice.Rmd from the files pane. Decide within your group who will be Group member 1, 2, 3, and so on. Each group member should edit this file on their own local machines by adding their name and only their name to the appropriate location in the document (line 5, 7, or 9) based on their assigned number. It’s very important that this be the only section of the document you edit. Save the file by clicking File&gt;Save.\n\n\n\n\nStage\nSometimes we make a changes to a few files, save them, and we’re ready to create a snapshot of our repo (i.e. create a commit) with some of those changes. Remember that creating this snapshot is almost like taking a photo of the repo at this particular moment, allowing us to later go back to that photo to see what the repo looked like in that moment. To let Git know which changes we want to include in that snapshot, we need to stage the files. Staging basically says, “these files are ready to be included in the snapshot.”\n\nQuestion\n\nOnce you save the file you’ll notice in the RStudio Git pane that the file name appears after a blue square labeled “M” (which stands for Modified). This means that the file is ready for staging. Stage the file - indicating that it’s ready for committing - by clicking the checkbox in front of the file name.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommit\nAs we just noted, committing changes basically means taking a snapshot of a repo at a particular moment in time. Commits are given unique hashes - sort of like a unique identifier that enables us to access the snapshot of the repo at a later date. In collaborative projects, it is typically recommended to commit often - after any major changes are made to a file. This ensures that we can eventually go back to look at very specific changes. It’s also important to label commits with descriptive titles so that we can recall what changes within that commit. Descriptive titles should detail what changes were made in the last round of edits.\nTo help put this into context, think back to our photograph metaphor. Let’s say that we are a photographer assigned to document how a baby develops in the first year of its life. If the photographer only took one photograph when the baby was 1 year old, we wouldn’t have a lot of documentation regarding how the baby developed! …so instead, let’s say that the photographer took a snapshot of the baby after every major milestone - their first laugh, their first solid food, their first crawl, their first word. We would have a lot more to go by when trying to understand how the baby developed. Same goes for committing code often.\nNow let’s say the photographer handed the batch of photos to the parents, and said - “look, here’s how your baby developed over time.” The parents might not remember which photograph was taken after which milestone. …but if the photographer were to label each photograph with things like “baby had first laugh,” the parents would be able to easily go back to specific moments in their baby’s development. This is why we want descriptive commit messages. We want to later be able to go back and scan through what changes were made after each commit.\nTo get a sense of what it means to be able to look back on these changes, check out the latest commits that I made to the GitHub repo for our course website. While I’m not going to claim to be the most diligent commit-er, you do get a basic sense of what changes were made to the repo following each commit from these commit messages. I could click through any of these links to see what my repo looked like at this moment in time.\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCommit your changes by clicking the ‘Commit’ button in the Git pane. When you click this button, a new window will open showcasing the changes that have been made to the staged file. You should enter a commit message in the window that appears. Remember that commit messages should be descriptive. In this case, something like “added &lt;your-name&gt;’s name” would work. Click commit. Now a snapshot of this version of the code repo has been taken.\n\n\n\n\nPush\nOnly your local machine knows that a change has been made to the code. Remember again how we said that the super fancy git folder knows that there is a remote version of the repository somewhere that you might want to keep it consistent with? Now we want to do the opposite of pulling changes from GitHub to our local machines. Instead, we want to push the changes on our local machines to GitHub.\n\nQuestion\n\nClick the Green upward arrow in the Git pane to push your changes to GitHub.\n\nOnce all group members have pushed their changes, head back over to GitHub. On the main code page, switch between branches and check out the contents of github-practice.Rmd in each branch. What differences do you notice?\n\n\n\n\nPull Request\nNote that now we have a few versions of our repo in separate branches on GitHub.com, and in each of those versions of the repo, the github-practice.Rmd file looks a little bit different. Now that we’ve made our changes and things are stable and polished, we want to move all of those changes into the main branch. To do this, we are going to issue a Pull Request. This is a request that signals to all of our collaborators that we are ready to move our changes back into the main branch.\n\nQuestion\n\nOn your repo’s page in GitHub.com, click the “Pull Requests” tab, and then click the green “New Pull Request” button. You’re requesting to pull the changes from your personal branch into the main branch. This means that the base branch should be main, and the compare branch should be your personal branch.\n\nYou’ll see a screen where you can compare your branch to the main branch. Click the button to “Create Pull Request,” enter a descriptive title of the changes made, and then click “Create Pull Request” again.\n\n\n\n\nReview Pull Requests\nI recommend that you get in the habit of reviewing your collaborator’s work before merging their changes into the main branch. By creating pull requests, we scaffold an opportunity to review each other’s work before fully integrating the changes.\nNow there should be a pull request for all members of your team. Assign one team member to review one other team member’s code. All team members should have one reviewer.\n\nQuestion\n\nOpen your own pull request in GitHub.com, and in the right sidebar, assign the team member responsible for reviewing your changes as a “Reviewer.”\n\nThen navigate to the pull request you are responsible for reviewing. Click on the “Files Changed” tab. Note that the left side of the screen shows the previous version of the file, and the right side of the screen shows the new version of the file. Lines in red have been deleted, and lines in green have been added.\n\nAfter looking through the changes, click the green button “Review changes.” Leave a note for your collaborator, indicating your evaluation of their changes. If everything looks good, check the radio button for “Approve.” If there are issues, check the radio button for “Request Changes.” Then click the button to “Submit Review.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf your reviewer requested changes, you should go back to RStudio, and make sure you are in your own branch. Then make the requested changes, save the file, stage the file, commit the changes, and push again. The changes to your file will be tracked in your pull request. After this, you may move on to the Merge step. See here for further options on dismissing or re-requesting reviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerge\nOnce all reviewers have approved changes, we are ready to merge those changes into the main branch. Open each pull request. If everything is good and ready to merge, you will see a green checkmark that says “This branch has no conflicts with the base branch.”\n\n(If you get a message that there are conflicts, call myself or one of the Data Assistants over.)\n\nQuestion\n\nClick the button to “Merge Pull Request”. In the comment box that appears, enter the text “closes #”. When you enter this text, you will see a dropdown of issues and pull requests currently in the repo. Issues will have an icon that appears as a circle with a dot in the center.\n\nSelect the issue associated with this pull request, and then click “Confirm Merge.” This will both merge the changes into the main branch and simultaneously close the issue you opened earlier. Finally, click the button to the delete the branch. Once this has been completed for all pull requests, head back over to the “Code” tab at GitHub.com, and check out github-practice.Rmd. What has happened to the file since merging the code? Navigate to the “Issues” tab. What has happened to the issues since confirming the merge?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore moving on to the next section…\n\n\n\nYou’ve now deleted branches at GitHub.com that your local machines don’t know have been deleted. Before moving on to the next step, you should navigate back to RStudio and pull these changes to your local machine by clicking the blue downward arrow. To streamline things in the next section of the lab, we are going to work entirely in the main branch (something that I would otherwise not recommend)."

    "section": "Error Resolution",
    "text": "Error Resolution\nThe workflow presented above seems to work all fine and dandy. …but there are a number of factors that can impede this seamless workflow. In this final section of the lab, we will go over three kinds of errors that you might come across in the workflow above, and talk about how you would resolve them. I can almost guarantee that you will deal with some of these issues when working on your group projects, so I would encourage you to keep this lab handy when engaging in project work.\n\nPush error\nA push error occurs when we make changes to files on our local machines, and go to commit and push them to GitHub.com, but other changes had already been made to the file at GitHub.com that were not yet pulled into our local environments. We get an error because our local repo is inconsistent with the remote repo. To fix this error, we need to pull changes to our local machine, and try committing and pushing again. Let’s replicate this error:\n\nQuestion\n\nOne of your partners should navigate to the GitHub.com repository. Click on the file README.md. Click the pencil icon to edit the file. Replace the text: ADD NAME 1 HERE ADD NAME 2 HERE, and so on with your names. Scroll to the bottom of the page and commit changes noting in the message that your names were added.\nOther partner: Return to RStudio. Do not pull changes yet. Open github-practice.Rmd. On line 40 change the ncol() function to dim(). Save the file. Stage and commit your changes. Click the green upward arrow to push your changes. You should get an error that looks like this.\n\nFollow the steps above to resolve the error.\n\n\n\nAn easy way to avoid a push error is to always click the blue downward arrow to pull remote changes before starting to edit files on your local machine.\n\n\n\n\nPull error\nA pull error occurs when changes have already been made to the same location (the same line number) in both a remote file and a local file, and then we try to pull the changes from the remote repo to our local machines. As far as Git can tell, there are two options for what this line is supposed to look like, and it can’t tell which to prioritize. So Git recommends that, as a first step, we commit the changes that we made locally. It’s basically saying, let’s take a snapshot of your local repo as it looks right now, so that later we can figure out what to do about this conflict.\nIf this seems confusing imagine this: let’s say you write a paper, and you share it with one of your classmates to review. The classmate reads through it, makes suggested changes to the opening sentence, and sends it back you. …but, while your classmate was reviewing the paper, you were getting antsy about the paper deadline and started making your own edits to the paper, including edits to the opening sentence. Now you’re trying to incorporate the changes from your classmate’s review, and you’re not sure what to do about that opening sentence. As a first step, you have two options you can scrap your recent changes (maybe your classmate’s suggestions were better!) or you can save a separate copy of the file with your recent changes and figure out later how to resolve the differences. That’s exactly what we are going to do here:\nTo fix this error, you should stage and commit your local changes and then try pulling again. Let’s replicate this error:\n\nQuestion\n\nOne of your partners should navigate to the GitHub.com repository. Click on the file github-practice.Rmd. Click the pencil icon to edit the file. Replace the code on line 47 with the following: colnames(pioneer_valley_2013).\nScroll to the bottom of the page and commit changes noting in the message how you updated the function.\nOther partner: Return to RStudio. Do not pull changes yet. Open github-practice.Rmd. Replace the code on line 47 with the following: ncol(pioneer_valley_2013)\nSave the file. Click the blue downward button to Pull changes. You should get an error that looks like this.\n\nFollow the steps above to resolve the error.\n\n\n\n\nMerge conflict\nSo now we have these two snapshots of github-practice.Rmd, and they are in conflict with one another. If we try to push our changes back to GitHub.com, Git is not going to know what to do. Should the file at GitHub.com look like the version currently at GitHub.com, should it look like the snapshot that we just commit to our local machines, or should it look like something else entirely?\nLet’s return to the example of trying to incorporate a peer’s edits to a paper that you have recently made changes to. We have to figure out what to do about that opening sentence. Do we want our version, their version, or some combination of the two? This is what it is like to fix a merge conflict.\nTo fix this error, open the file with conflicts and edit the lines with conflict.\n\nQuestion\n\nOne of your partners should try to pull changes by clicking the blue downward arrow in RStudio. You will get an error that looks like this:\n{fig-alt=“This is the window that we see when we get a merge conflict. It says: CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md}\nTo fix this one your partners should open the file with the conflict. In this case it will be github-practice.Rmd. Scroll to the section of the file with the conflict. It will now look something like this:\n    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\n\n    ncol(pioneer_valley_2013)\n\n    =======\n\n    colnames(pioneer_valley_2013)\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ee175895783b64e0e1f696d9456be4c4c7c3f3bf\nThe code following HEAD represents the recent changes you made on your local machine, and the code right before the long string of characters represents the changes that were made in an earlier commit (the long string of characters is the commit hash). Decide what that line should look like and delete all other content. This means you must delete “&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD”, “=======”, and “&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;long-hash&gt;”, and you likely should delete at least one other line. Save the file, stage the file by clicking the checkbox next to the file in the Git page, and then commit your changes, and push them to GitHub.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding Merge Conflicts\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that the most frustrating merge conflicts tend to emerge when we have two people working on the same line of a repo’s file. The most effective way to avoid merge conflicts is to ensure that collaborators are working on different documents or different lines in a file. One way you might do this when starting to work on your group project is to open a file that you all plan to work on and having one of your team mates section off space of that file for different people to work. It might look something like this:\n\nOnce this change has been made, that group mate should stage, commit, and push the file to GitHub, and all other group mates should pull the change to their local machines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPath of Least Resistance\nI have been working with GitHub for years, and even to this day, I run into instances where things become so inconsistent between my local machine and the repo at GitHub.com that the fastest way to fix things is just to save local copies of the files that I’ve changed to somewhere else on my machine, delete the super fancy Git folder from its current location, and then re-clone the most up-to-date remote version to my local machine. Then I can figure out how I want to edit the most up-to-date version with my changes. This comic from XKCD captures this widely acknowledged solution beautifully:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthical Considerations\n\n\n\nIncreasingly, when data science researchers publish a paper in a journal, they are making the code they used to reach certain results freely available on GitHub.com for other researchers and the public to review. This is in part a response to the reproducibility crisis that you learned about in SDS 100. What do you see as the social benefits to making the code behind a data science finding publicly available online? What might be some of the social consequences of making this code freely available? How might we mitigate these consequences? Share your ideas on our sds-192-discussions Slack channel."

One initiative that they oversee towards this end is the Continuum of Care Program. Continuums of Care (CoCs) are local planning organizations responsible for allocating resources and coordinating services to address homelessness in the United States. Every state has a number of CoCs that report to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nEvery year, on a single night in the last 10 days of January, CoCs required to conduct a “point-in-time” count of sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals. To generate the sheltered point-in-time count, CoCs coordinate with transitional housing centers or emergency shelters to record the number of people housed in that location on the selected night. There are a few different approaches to generating an unsheltered point-in-time count:\n\n“Night of” street count: Volunteers are sent out to canvass either the entire geography of a random sample of areas in a CoC. While canvassing, they are expected to record the number of people they see currently residing in spaces not designed for sleeping accommodations.\nService-based count: In the 7 days following the night of the designated PIT count, volunteers are dispatched to food kitchens, shelters, libraries and other services identified as spaces that unhoused individuals frequent. There, they are expected to survey individuals to determine if they were sheltered on the night of the count.\n\nFollowing the night of the count, the collected data points are shipped off to HUD where they are aggregated into the dataset we will be working with today.\nThere are a number of limitations to this approach of estimating homelessness, which I encourage you to consider throughout this analysis and when responding to our Ethical Considerations question."

    "href": "labs/lab7.html#data-cleaning",
    "title": "Lab 7: Tidying Data",
    "section": "Data Cleaning",
    "text": "Data Cleaning\nFirst, let’s consider each of our data frames. You have pit, which documents homelessness counts from 2015 to 2020 in each state along a number of categories (such as gender, race, sheltered vs. unsheltered, etc.). Note how in this data frame each row is a state, and each variable is a count associated with a particular category.\n\nhead(pit)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis is an example of untidy data. The reason is that there is data we want to visualize (such as race, gender, year, and sheltered vs. unsheltered) that are stored in our column headers, not in cells of the data frame. To be able to visualize this data by race, by gender, or by year we need to pivot our data frames so that the values stored in column headers instead get restored in data cells.\n\nQuestion\n\nWrite code to pivot longer columns 2 through 117 (i.e. all columns except the first state column) in pit. Store the names in column called “Measure” and store the values in a column called “Value.” Store the resulting data frame in in pit_pivoted.\n\n\n# Uncomment below and write code to pivot dataset. Store the results in pit_pivoted\n\n# pit_pivoted &lt;- pit |&gt; pivot_longer(_____)\n\n\n\nIf you’ve done this correctly the first six rows of the resulting data frame should look like this.\n\nhead(pit_pivoted)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNow you’ll notice that that we have some more cleaning to do because many separate variables are all stored in the Measure column. We have: the year, the demographic, whether the count is for Sheltered or Unsheltered individuals all stored in the column. We need to separate all of these distinct variables into different columns. We’re going to do this in a few steps.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nWrite code to separate Measure into two columns. One column should be called Shel_Unshel, and the second should be called Demographic. Note what symbol separates these two pieces of data: space dash space (i.e. ” - “). You will need to specify this in the sep argument for separate(). Store the resulting data frame in in pit_separate_1.\n\n\n# Uncomment below and complete the code to separate the Measure column. Store the results in pit_separate_1\n\n# pit_separate_1 &lt;- pit_pivoted |&gt; separate(_____)\n\n\n\nIf you’ve done this correctly the first six rows of the resulting data frame should look like this.\n\nhead(pit_separate_1)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe still have some cleaning to do because we have demographic data and year data are stored in the same column.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nWrite code to separate Demographic into two columns. One column should be called Demographic, and the second should be called Year. Note what symbol separates these two pieces of data: comma space (i.e. “,”). You will need to specify this in the sep argument for separate(). Store the resulting data frame in in pit_separate_2.\n\n\n# Uncomment below and complete the code to separate the Demographic column. Store the results in pit_separate_2\n\n# pit_separate_2 &lt;- pit_separate_1 |&gt; separate(_____)\n\n\n\nIf you’ve done this correctly the first six rows of the resulting data frame should look like this.\n\nhead(pit_separate_2)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAs a final cleaning step, let’s remove some unnecessary characters from the Shel_Unshel column. Specifically, let’s remove the string “Total” since we already know that these represent Total counts for these categories.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nRemove the string “Total” from the Shel_Unshel column. To do this you should use the str_replace() function. Replace the string “Total” with the empty string (i.e. ““) to remove these characters. Store the results in pit_str_cleaned.\n\n\n# Uncomment below and complete the code to replace the string \"Total \" in Shel_Unshel with an empty string. Store the results in pit_str_cleaned\n\n# pit_str_cleaned &lt;- pit_separate_2 |&gt; mutate(Shel_Unshel = _______)\n\n\n\nIf you’ve done this correctly the first six rows of the resulting data frame should look like this.\n\nhead(pit_str_cleaned)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe next issue is that there are multiple kinds of demographics in the demographic column. Specifically, we have both race represented in that column and gender represented in that column. Remember the rules of tidy data, according to Wickham (2014):\n\nEach variable forms a column.\nEach observation forms a row.\nEach type of observational unit forms a table.\n\nThis issue violates the third rule. In one table, we have two observational units - a count of unhoused individuals by race and a count of unhoused individuals by gender. To clean this up, we need to separate this into different tables.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCreate two new data frames - one for pit_by_gender and one for pit_by_race. To do this you want to extract the rows with values in Demographic %in% the following vector of values: c(\"Female\", \"Male\", \"Transgender\"), and store the result in pit_by_gender. Then you want to extract the rows with values in Demographic %in% the following vector of values:\nc(\"Black or African American\", \n  \"Asian\", \n  \"American Indian or Alaska Native\", \n  \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\", \n  \"White\", \n  \"Multiple Races\")\nand store the result in pit_by_race.\n\n\n# Uncomment below to create two new tables.\n\n# pit_by_gender &lt;- pit_str_cleaned |&gt;\n# pit_by_race &lt;- pit_str_cleaned |&gt;\n\n\n\nIf you’ve done this correctly the first six rows of the resulting data frame should look like this.\n\nhead(pit_by_gender)\n\n\n  \n\n\nhead(pit_by_race)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNow we have two significantly cleaned data tables. Let’s go ahead and remove some of the data frames we no longer need from our environmennt.\n\nrm(pit, pit_pivoted, pit_separate_1, pit_separate_2, pit_str_cleaned)\n\nWith the final data, we could visualize counts of homelessness per state using each of these tables. Check out the plot below to see an example of what this might look like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem now is that we don’t know if higher counts are a result of greater homelessness for that sub-group or a result of there being higher populations of that sub-group in each state. For instance, in the plot above, is the count of homelessness higher for unsheltered white individuals because white individuals are more likely to be homeless or because there is a higher population of white individuals in Florida? We ultimately want to consider the rates of homelessness per x number of people of that demographic in that state. To do that, we’re going to need to join this dataset with some census data documenting population.\nI’ve supplied you with two census tables:\n\ngender: documents population estimates and margin of error (moe) for each gender in each state from 2015-2020\n\n\nhead(gender)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nrace: documents population estimates and margin of error (moe) for each race in each state from 2015-2020\n\n\nhead(race)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNote that in these two data frames - just like above - we have values stored in our column headers, and we need to pivot our data longer and then clean it up. We’re going to complete this in three parts.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCreate two new tidy data frames - gender_final and race_final. For each, you should do this in 3 steps:\nStep 1: Pivot the columns estimate_2015:moe_2020 longer, storing the column names in “Measure” and the values in “Values”. Step 2: Separate the values in Measure into two columns: “Measure”, “Year”. Note that these are separated by an underscore (“_“). Step 3: Pivot the Measure column wider, taking the values from the Values column.\n\n\n# Fill in the blanks to clean up these data frames. \n\n# Step 1\n#gender_pivoted_longer &lt;- gender |&gt; pivot_longer(_____)\n\n# Step 2\n#gender_separated &lt;- gender_pivoted |&gt; separate(_____)\n\n# Step 3\n#gender_final &lt;- gender_separated |&gt; pivot_wider(_____)\n\n# Step 1\n#race_pivoted_longer &lt;- race |&gt; pivot_longer(_____)\n\n# Step 2\n#race_separated &lt;- race_pivoted |&gt; separate(_____)\n\n# Step 3\n#race_final &lt;- race_separated |&gt; pivot_wider(_____)\n\n\n\nIf you’ve done this correctly the first six rows of the resulting data frame should look like this.\n\nhead(gender_final)\n\n\n  \n\n\nhead(gender_final)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNow that we have cleaned up census data, let’s go ahead and remove some data frames that we no longer need in our environments\n\nrm(gender, gender_pivoted_longer, gender_separated, race, race_pivoted_longer, race_separated)\n\nOur next step is to join the census data with our point-in-time count data tables. Let’s just compare pit_by_gender to gender_final to discern the join key.\n\nhead(pit_by_gender)\n\n\n  \n\n\nhead(gender_final)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNotice that here, we need to join on three variables: the state, the year, and the demographic. …but you might have noticed a problem. In our census data table, states are written out, and in our point-in-time data table, states are abbreviated. The values need to match for the join to work, so we will need to create a new column with the full state name in our point-in-time count data table. I’ve written the code to do this below. You should run that code before moving on to the next step.\n\npit_by_gender &lt;- \n  pit_by_gender |&gt;\n  mutate(StateName = state.name[match(State, state.abb)])\n  \npit_by_race &lt;- \n  pit_by_race |&gt;\n  mutate(StateName = state.name[match(State, state.abb)])\n\nNow our data frames are formatted in such a way that we can join pit_by_gender to gender_final and pit_by_race to race_final.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nJoin pit_by_gender on the left to gender_final on the right and store the results in pit_gender. Join pit_by_race on the left to race_final on the right and store the results in pit_race. In both case, you will be joining by three variables: State, Demographic, and Year. We can set the left key variables to the right key variables by setting the by argument to this in the join: c(\"StateName\" = \"NAME\", \"Demographic\" = \"variable\", \"Year\" = \"Year\")\n\n\n# Uncomment below and write code to join pit_by_gender to gender_final and pit_by_race to race_final. Store the results in pit_gender and pit_race respectively.\n\n# pit_gender &lt;- pit_by_gender |&gt;\n# pit_race &lt;- pit_by_race |&gt;\n\n\n\nIf you’ve done this correctly the first six rows of the resulting data frames should look like this.\n\nhead(pit_gender)\n\n\n  \n\n\nhead(pit_race)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nOne final step before we can create our plots! We need to create a new column that calculates the rate of homelessness for this sub-group per 10,000 population of that sub-group in that state and year. You have all of the pieces you need to do this now.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nUse a data wrangling verb to create a new column in both pit_gender and pit_race that calculates the rate of homelessness per 10,000 population. Set that column name to homeless_rate. Hint: When creating that column, you’ll need to divide the homeless count by the population estimate and then multiply by 10000.

However, other sources (such as surveys in public schools) have shown that the majority of unhoused individuals are not on the streets or in shelters, but instead are temporarily residing with family/friends or are in staying in motels.\nAs living on the streets is increasingly criminalized in cities across the U.S., there are reasons why unhoused individuals may try to avoid being seen on a given night.\nOnly recently have counting protocols started to include separate categories for Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming individuals. When counting PIT data against census population data, however, these sub-groups won’t appear because the census only collects Sex as “Male” and “Female”.\nDifferent CoCs use different methods to generate PIT counts.\n\nFor more information see e National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty (2017).\nTaking into consideration all of these factors, how should we, as data scientists, think about and present this data? Is there value in PIT count data? How should we go about communicating its shortcomings? How might we go about collecting this data in different ways?

This involves regularly inspecting facilities for their compliance with different environmental laws, issuing notices and taking enforcement actions when facilities are out of compliance, and issuing penalties for failures to address violations. A record of all of this activity is maintained online in a database known as ECHO - Enforcement and Compliance History Online. Specifically, ECHO maintains information about enforcement and compliance actions taken in relation to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.\nThere is so much information available to us via ECHO, and there is even an R package that makes it really simple to access the data in ECHO. However, because ECHO documents compliance with a number of different environmental laws, when we pull data from ECHO about regulated facilities, it is usually organized into separate tables for each law. Today we are going to pull a dataset documenting facilities’ compliance with the Clean Air Act and then pull a second dataset documenting facilities’ compliance with the Clean Water Act.\nThe Clean Air Act was first enacted in 1963 to regulate emissions from both stationary and mobile sources of air pollution. The Clean Water Act was enacted in 1972 regulate the polluting of U.S. waterways. When a facility violates one of these Acts, it typically means that they have released an excess amount of pollutants, neglected to implement the proper control technologies or standards, or failed to submit reports."

    "text": "Data Analysis\n\nJoin Keys\nWhen joining data frames, we need to determine a join key. This will be a variable that exists in both data frames to uniquely identify the data frames’ units of observation. This key needs to be shared across the two data frames in order to be able to join the data frames together. This is because when joining data frames, R will check the value in that variable for one data frame and look for the corresponding value in the key variable for the other data frame in order to determine which units of observation match across the data frames.\nFor instance, let’s say we have two data frames documenting the same group of students - one documents their current courses, and another documents their living arrangements. For both data frames, the student ID might serve as a join key. This ID uniquely identifies each student, and we expect that that key will be the same in both data frames (i.e. the 99- that represents you in one data frame will be the same as the 99- number that represents you in another data frame.) Because that number matches across the two data frames, we can use that variable to determine which rows (i.e. students) in the first data frame are associated with which rows in the second data frame.\n\nQuestion\n\nReference the data dictionaries for these two data frames to determine the names of the variables that we will join on. Remember that these should be variables that we can use to uniquely identify each unit of observation across the data frames. Write code below to determine the number of unique values for the variables you identify in each of these data frames. (Hint: Remember how we counted unique values in a variable in lab 1?)\n\n\n# Write code here for echo_air_ca\n# Write code here for echo_water_ca\n\n\n\nIf you’ve done this correctly, you’ll learn that there are 2710 unique values echo_air_ca’s key variable. You’ll also learn that there are 28993 unique values in echo_water_ca’s key variable.\n…but if you look in your environment, there are 2907 rows in echo_air_ca, and there are 31678 rows in echo_water_ca. This means that the key variable must repeat, and that certain facilities are represented more than once in each of these data frames.\nThis happens because even the EPA defines a facility in different ways depending on what laws it is regulated by. What counts as one facility in the Clean Air Act may count as two or three facilities in the Clean Water Act, but there is only one ID to document the relationships between them. This means that the same ID may show up a few times for different parts of the same facility. Check out some of the duplicating rows via my code below. Notice how multiple facilities - sometimes with entirely different names can be associated with the same RegistryID?\n\necho_air_ca |&gt;\n  group_by(RegistryID) |&gt;\n  filter(n() &gt; 1) |&gt;\n  arrange(RegistryID) |&gt;\n  head()\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nLater we will talk about what happens when we join two data frames that both have repeating keys, but for now, we’re going aggregate both of these data frames so that each Registry ID only appears once. Basically, we are going to write code to say: if any of the rows pertaining to this Registry ID document certain kinds of violations, set the violation flag for that facility to 1.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nIn the code below, for each of the data frames, you should group the data by RegistryID and then summarize by returning the max() value in CurrSvFlag, ViolFlag, CurrVioFlag, Insp5yrFlag for each group. Store the results in echo_air_ca_agg and echo_water_ca_agg respectively. Note how many rows in are in echo_air_ca_agg and echo_water_ca_agg. It should match the number of unique values in RegistryID that you calculated above.\n\n\necho_air_ca_agg &lt;-\n  echo_air_ca |&gt;\n  ______ |&gt;             #group by RegistryID\n  _____(                #Summarize the following:\n    CurrSvFlag = _____, #Calculate max value in CurrSvFlag\n    ViolFlag = _____,   #Calculate max value in ViolFlag\n    CurrVioFlag = _____,#Calculate max value in CurrVioFlag\n    Insp5yrFlag = _____ #Calculate max value in Insp5yrFlag\n  )\n\necho_water_ca_agg &lt;- #Copy and adjust code above to create echo_water_ca_agg\n\n\n\n\nJoins\nSo now we have two data frames with unique registry IDs and variables indicating whether the facility has a current significant violation, whether it has had a violation in the past three years, whether it has a current violation, and whether it has been inspected in the past 5 years.\nNow we want to join these two data frames together, so that we can check which facilities have violations to both the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.\n\nQuestion\n\nWrite code below to perform four kinds of joins - a left join, a right join, and inner join, and a full join. echo_water_ca_agg should be in the first position, and echo_air_ca_agg should be joined onto it. I’ve started that for you in the commented code below.\n\n\n#joined_left &lt;- echo_water_ca_agg |&gt; \n\n#joined_right &lt;- echo_water_ca_agg |&gt; \n\n#joined_inner &lt;- echo_water_ca_agg |&gt; \n\n#joined_full &lt;- echo_water_ca_agg |&gt; \n\n\n\nCheck out the first six rows of joined_full below and note what happens when a RegistryID is present in one data frame but not in the other. We see data values in the columns associated with the data frame where the RegistryID was present, and NA values in the columns associated with the data frame where the RegistryID was not present. This is how we come to have so many extra rows in joined_full.\n\njoined_full |&gt; head()\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWith joined_inner, any rows associated with a RegistryID that doesn’t appear in both data frames get dropped. Check out the number of rows in joined_inner.\n\nnrow(joined_inner)\n\n[1] 766\n\n\nThis represents the number of Registry IDs that were present in both echo_water_ca_agg and echo_air_ca_agg.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nThe three statements below are incorrect. Correct my statements below about the remaining joins.\n\n\npaste(nrow(joined_full), \"represents the number of Registry IDs present in echo_air_ca_agg\")\n\npaste(nrow(joined_left), \"represents the number of Registry IDs present in either echo_air_ca_agg or echo_water_ca_agg\")\n\npaste(nrow(joined_right), \"represents the number of Registry IDs present in echo_water_ca_agg\")\n\n\n\nFrom here on out, since we are only interested in the facilities with violations to both Acts, we are going to focus on joined_inner. Let’s remove the rest of the joined data frames from our environment.\n\nrm(joined_full, joined_left, joined_right)\n\nYou might note at this point that it can be difficult to tell which columns are associated with which environmental laws. This is because originally in both data frames, the variables we are most interested in (CurrSvFlag, ViolFlag, CurrVioFlag, Insp5yrFlag) shared the same names. When we joined these two data frames together, R opted to distinguish between them by tacking a .x onto the variable names for the data frame in the first position in the join and a .y onto the variable names for the data frame in the second position in the join. Let’s give each of these variables more meaningful names. To do so, we can use the rename() function, which is included in the dplyr package in the tidyverse. When piped to a dataframe, the formula for rename() is simple: rename(new_name = old_name)\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nIn my code below rename the remaining columns to differentiate between the column names from the two original data frames.\n\n\njoined_inner_renamed &lt;-\n  joined_inner |&gt;\n  rename(\n    CurrSvFlag_water = CurrSvFlag.x,\n    ViolFlag_water = ViolFlag.x \n    #Rename remaining columns here. Be sure to separate by comma. There are six more to go!\n  )\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nNow that we have a cleaned up data frame, use a data wrangling verb to subset the data frame to the rows where a RegistryID has a current violation to both the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. Repeat these steps to determine which RegistryIDs have a significant violation to both Acts. I recommend running this on joined_inner_renamed.\nOnce you’ve run these codes, open both echo_air_ca and echo_water_ca by clicking on the data frames in your environment. Search for a few of the RegistryIDs that appeared in your analysis to identify the names and locations of the facilities.\n\n\n# Write wrangling code here for current violations. \n\n# Write wrangling code here for significant violations. \n\n\n\n\nMany-to-Many Joins\nWe don’t know much about these facilities because we lost a lot of critical information (e.g. the facility’s name and location) when aggregating our data by RegistryID above. At the time, we couldn’t aggregate by name because certain facilities sharing the same RegistryID had different names! Aggregating by name would have meant that we’d still have repeating RegistryIds in the data frame - one for each different version of the facility’s name.\nThe truth is though that we didn’t technically have to ensure that the RegistryID didn’t repeat. We can still join data frames in instances where the join key repeats in both data frames. This is called performing a many-to-many join because we are joining many of the same key in one data frame to many of the same key in another data frame. It’s important to pay attention to what happens when we make this join. Let’s look at an example: the facility with Registry ID 110001181186.\n\necho_air_ca |&gt;\n  filter(RegistryID == 110001181186) \n\n\n  \n\n\necho_water_ca |&gt;\n  filter(RegistryID == 110001181186)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIn echo_air_ca, this RegistryID appears three times in the data frame, and in echo_water_ca, this RegistryID appears twice in the data frame. In each instance, the facility has a different name. What happens to facility 110001181186 when we perform a many-to-many join?\n\necho_water_ca |&gt; \n  inner_join(echo_air_ca, by = \"RegistryID\") |&gt; \n  filter(RegistryID == 110001181186) |&gt;\n  select(CWPName, AIRName, RegistryID)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis inner join created six rows for facility 110001181186. This is because R matched each of the three rows for facility 110001181186 in echo_air_ca with the two rows for facility 110001181186 in echo_water_ca (and 3 rows * 2 rows = 6 rows).\nThis is one of the reasons why it is important to understand the context of datasets and their units of observation. Here we’ve joined these rows together as if they represented matching facilities. …but just by looking at this output we know that PLATFORM A is going to be physically different than DOS CUADRAS/SOUTH COUNTY/PLATFORM B, and PLATFORM B is going to be physically different than DOS CUADRAS/SOUTH COUNTY/PLATFORM C. The only thing that they all share is that they are sub-parts of the facility with the RegistryID 110001181186. Ultimately the units of observation don’t match across these two data frames because Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act delineate facilities differently. By aggregating to RegistryID above - something shared across the two Acts - we standardized the unit of observation, which made it possible to perform a more meaningful join.\n\nQuestion\n\nUsing my code as an example, determine how many times facility 110000483619 appears in echo_air_ca and how many times it appears in echo_water_ca. How many times would this facility show up if we were to perform a many-to-many inner join for these two data frames? Write your response as a comment in the code chunk.\n\n\n#Write code here for echo_air_ca!\n\n#Write code here for echo_water_ca!\n\n#Write comment here!\n\n\n\n\nFiltering Joins\nSometimes we want to know which observations that appear in one data frame don’t appear in another data frame. This might tell us where we have missing data. In this case, it will tell us which facilities are regulated by one environmental law and not the other.\n\nQuestion\n\nWrite code below to perform two anti_join()s. The first should tell me which facilities are regulated by the Clean Air Act and not the Clean Water Act, and the second should tell me which facilities are regulated by the Clean Water Act and not the Clean Air Act.\n\n\n#not_clean_water &lt;- Write code here!\n\n#not_clean_air &lt;- Write code here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthical Considerations\n\n\n\nIn March 2020, the Environmental Protection Agency published a memo that permitted industrial facilities impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic to temporarily suspend mandated pollution monitoring. Research published by the Environmental Data Governance Initiative (EDGI) (Nost et al. 2020) has indicated that, during this time, reported violations to the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act dropped considerably. However, EDGI’s report goes on to argue that violations were likely being under-counted at this time. …first, because facilities were not being required to monitor and report data to the same degree during Covid-19, and second, because the EPA was conducting fewer inspections during Covid-19. In sum, as they say, “the absence of data should not be taken as the absence of pollution.” What social harms emerge in the wake of these data absences? Who benefits from these policies, and who faces the greatest risks? How should we as data scientists think and act as we anaylze and present this data?"

Through this research, they have been able to show that stops increased almost 700% from 2002 to 2011 - the year that marked the height of stop and frisk activity in NYC.\nWhen the NYPD’s use of stop and frisk went before the US District Court in the early 2010s, these public databases were integral in proving that stop and frisk was being carried out in NYC in an unconstitutional way. The ruling mandated that the NYPD create a policy outlining when stops were authorized, and since the practice has declined. See (Smith 2018) and (Southall and Gold 2019) for more information."

    "text": "Analysis\nTerry v. Ohio ruled that officers with “reasonable suspicion” that a stopped individual was carrying a weapon may frisk that individual for weapons.\nIn order to assess how “reasonable suspicion” was being applied in NYC in 2011, we are eventually going to analyze how many 2011 stops resulted in a frisk, how many frisks resulted in a weapon found on an individual, and how many stops resulted in either an arrest or summons.\nThe original dataset had separate variables for indicating whether a pistol, rifle, assault weapon, knife, machine gun, or other weapon was found on a suspect. We will create a variable equal to 1 if any of these weapons were found on the suspect. Further, the original dataset had separate variables for indicating whether a stop resulted in an arrest made or summons issued. We will create a variable equal to 1 if either occurred.\n\nQuestion\n\nAdd two new columns. The first should indicate whether a weapon was found, and the second should indicate whether an arrest/summons was made.\n\n\nsqf_2011 &lt;- \n  sqf_2011 |&gt;\n  #Add a variable for weapon found\n  _____(wpnfound = case_when(pistol == 1 |\n                               riflshot == 1 | \n                               asltweap == 1 |\n                               knifcuti == 1 | \n                               machgun == 1 | \n                               othrweap == 1 ~ 1,\n                             TRUE ~ 0))\nsqf_2011 &lt;- \n  sqf_2011 |&gt;\n  #Add a variable for arrest made or summons issued\n  _____(arrestsumm = case_when(sumissue == 1 | \n                                arstmade == 1 ~ 1,\n                               TRUE ~ 0))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\ncase_when() allows us to assign values based on whether certain criteria is met. Here is the basic formula:\ncase_when(\n  &lt;criteria to check&gt; ~ &lt;set to this value if criteria is met&gt;, \n  TRUE ~ &lt;set to this value if criteria is not met&gt;\n  )\nCheck out the code above. In the first line of code, we set the value for wpnfound to 1 if the first criteria is met (i.e. if pistol equals 1 or riflshot equals 1, and so on.) Otherwise, we set the value for wpnfound to 0.\n\n\nNow that you’ve run this code, open up the data frame in the View window. What is the unit of observation in this dataset? What variables describe each row?\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWe don’t need all of these columns in this data frame for this analysis. In fact, to replicate the NYCLU’s 2011 analysis, we only need six columns from this data frame.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nSubset the dataset to the six variables listed in the data dictionary above.\n\n\nsqf_2011 &lt;-\n  sqf_2011 |&gt;\n  _____(pct, arrestsumm, _____, wpnfound, race_cat, _____)\n\n\n\nIn order to be able to determine the percentage of stops that resulted in a frisk, weapon found, or arrest/summons, we are going to need to know how many total stops were conducted in NYC in 2011. We are going to store that value in the variable total_stops so that we can refer to it later.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCalculate the number of stops in 2011. If you are not sure which function to use below, you may want to refer to the list of Summary functions in the the Data Wrangling cheatsheet. Remember that each row in the data frame is a stop.\n\n\ntotal_stops &lt;-\n  sqf_2011 |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = _____) |&gt;\n  pull()\n\ntotal_stops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nsummarize() will return a data frame with the summarized value. Remember a data frame is a two-dimensional table with rows and columns (even if it’s a 1x1 table). If we want just the value, we can call pull() to extract the value from that two–dimensional table.\n\n\nRecall that for stops to be legally justified, officers must have “reasonable suspicion” that an individual committed a crime. This means that officers must be able to offer “specific and articulable facts,” along with rational inferences based on those facts, that an individual had committed a crime, in order to justify a stop. Reasonable suspicion requires more than a ‘hunch’.\nFor this reason, one of first metrics that the NYCLU calculates in their reports is the number and percentage of stops in which in the stopped individuals turned out to be innocent.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nHow many stops did not result in an arrest or summons in 2011? What percentage of stops did not result in an arrest or summons?\n\n\nsqf_2011 |&gt;\n  #Subset to rows where suspect innocent\n  _____(arrestsumm _____ 0) |&gt; \n  #Calculate number of observations\n  _____(total_innocent = n(), \n            percent_innocent = _____ / total_stops * 100)\n\n\n\nIn order to assess how stop and frisk may be carried out in a discriminatory way, the NYCLU’s reports go on to look at stops through the lens of a number of demographic indicators, including the age, race, gender, and ethnicity of the individuals stopped. For starters, let’s look at how many young people (14-24) were stopped in NYC in 2011.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nIn how many stops were the individuals aged 14-24? In what percentage of stops were the individuals aged 14-24?\n\n\nsqf_2011 |&gt;\n  #Subset to rows where suspect age 14-24\n  _____(age _____ 14 & age _____ 24) |&gt; \n  #Calculate number of observations and percentage of observations\n  _____(total_14_24 = _____, \n            percent_14_24 = n() / total_stops * 100)\n\n\n\nWhy doesn’t this match the values we see on the NYCLU website?\nNote the following from the NYCLU’s 2011 report on Stop, Question, and Frisk data:\n\n“In a negligible number of cases, race and age information is not recorded in the database. Throughout this report, percentages of race and age are percentages of those cases where race and age are recorded, not of all stops.”\n\nNote that it is very common in government datasets for missing values to get coded as 999 or -999. Here we want to exclude those values in the age column.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nFix the code below to calculate the currect number of stops for individuals 14-24.\n\n\ntotal_stops_age_recorded &lt;-\n  sqf_2011 |&gt;\n  #Subset to rows where age is not 999\n  _____(age _____ 999) |&gt; \n  summarize(Count = n()) |&gt;\n  pull()\n\nsqf_2011 |&gt;\n  filter(age &gt;= 14 & age &lt;= 24) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_14_24 = n(), \n            percent_14_24 = n() / total_stops_age_recorded * 100)\n\nThis still doesn’t match the values we see on the website, but it does match the values we see in the NYCLU’s 2011 report on Stop, Question, and Frisk data. This is typically when I would reach out to a representative at the NYCLU to inquire about the discrepancy.\n\n\nQuestion\n\nHow many stops were there per race in 2011? What percentage of stops per race in 2011? Arrange by number of stops in descending order.\n\n\ntotal_stops_race_recorded &lt;-\n  sqf_2011 |&gt;\n  #Subset to rows where race_cat is not NA or \"OTHER\"\n  filter(_____(race_cat) & race_cat _____ \"OTHER\") |&gt; \n  summarize(Count = n()) |&gt;\n  pull()\n\nsqf_2011 |&gt;\n  #Subset to rows where race_cat is not NA or \"OTHER\"\n  _____(_____(race_cat) & race_cat _____ \"OTHER\") |&gt; \n  #Group by race\n  _____(race_cat) |&gt; \n  #Calculate number of observations\n  _____(stops = n(), \n            percent_stops = n() / total_stops_race_recorded * 100) |&gt;\n  #Sort by stops in descending order\n  _____(_____(stops)) \n\n\n\nNote how this dataset categorizes race. Many different government datasets categorize race in many different ways. How we categorize race matters for how we can talk about discrimination and racial profiling. Imagine if WHITE was not categorized separately from WHITE-HISPANIC. The values in this dataset would appear very differently!\nWhen compiling their report, the NYCLU chose to aggregate two racial categories in this dataset into the one category - Latinx - in order to advance certain claims regarding discrimination. What we should remember is that these racial categories are not reported by those stopped; they are recorded by officers stopping individuals. They may not reflect how individuals identify themselves.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nIn how many stops were the individuals identified as Latinx (i.e. “WHITE-HISPANIC” or “BLACK-HISPANIC”)? In what percentage of stops were the individuals identified as Latinx?\n\n\nsqf_2011 |&gt;\n  #Subset to rows where race_cat is \"WHITE-HISPANIC\" or \"BLACK-HISPANIC\"\n  _____(race_cat _____ c(\"WHITE-HISPANIC\", \"BLACK-HISPANIC\")) |&gt; \n  #Calculate number of observations\n  _____(stops_Latinx = _____, \n            percent_Latinx = n() / total_stops_race_recorded * 100)\n\n\n\nAs a final consideration, we are going to calculate some summary statistics to further our understanding of the discriminatory ways in which this practice was being carried out. To so so, we are going to look at a racial breakdown of which stops resulted in an arrest/summons, and which frisks resulted in a weapon found.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nWhat percentage of stops in 2011 resulted in a frisk per race? What percentage of stops in 2011 resulted in a weapon found per race? What percentage of stops in 2011 resulted in an arrest or summons per race? In your resulting data table, each row should be a race, and there should be columns for stops, percent_stops, percent_frisked, percent_wpnfound , and percent_arrestsumm.\n\n\n# Write code here. \n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nBelow, in 2-3 sentences, summarize what you learn from reviewing the summary statistics from the code above. What does this tell us about the constitutionality of 2011 stop and frisk activity in NYC?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthical Considerations\n\n\n\nIn her ruling in the 2011 District Court case Floyd vs. the City of New York, Honorable Shira Sheidlen remarked the following regarding the database of stops we analyzed today:\n\nBecause it is impossible to individually analyze each of those stops, plaintiffs’ case was based on the imperfect information contained in the NYPD’s database of forms (“UF-250s”) that officers are required to prepare after each stop. The central flaws in this database all skew toward underestimating the number of unconstitutional stops that occur: the database is incomplete, in that officers do not prepare a UF-250 for every stop they make; it is one-sided, in that the UF250 only records the officer’s version of the story; the UF-250 permits the officer to merely check a series of boxes, rather than requiring the officer to explain the basis for her suspicion; and many of the boxes on the form are inherently subjective and vague (such as “furtive movements”). Nonetheless, the analysis of the UF-250 database reveals that at least 200,000 stops were made without reasonable suspicion.\n\nWhat are some of the consequences of the incompleteness and/or one-sided nature of this dataset? How should we think about and communicate its flaws vs its value? How might this data collection program be redesigned so as to represent more diverse perspectives? Share your ideas on our sds-192-discussions Slack channel.\n\n\n\n#If you finish early, I encourage you to attempt to plot some of this data below using `ggplot()`!"

Here we reference the column from the data frame we wish to color the points by using the accessor $.\n\nIn addition, the colorBin() function takes the argument bins, which indicates the number of color intervals to be created. The colorQuantile() functions takes the argument n, which indicates the number of quantiles to map data into.\n\nQuestion\n\nCreate three palettes below (one using each function colorNumeric(), colorBin(), and colorQuantile()), setting the palette to “YlOrRd”, and the domain to worst_buildings$avg_violations_weighted. For colorBin(), set the bins to 4, and for colorQuantile(), set n to 4.\n\n\npal_num &lt;- colorNumeric(palette=\"YlOrRd\", \n                        domain = worst_buildings$avg_violations_weighted)\n#Uncomment below to create the other two palettes.\n\n#pal_bin &lt;- \n\n#pal_quant &lt;- \n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCopy and paste the last map you created into the code chunk below, three times. For each, we are going to adjust the fillColor by setting it to the variable from the dataset that we wish to color (avg_violations_weighted), colored by one of the palettes that we created. We can do this by setting the fill color argument equal to:\n\n~pal_num(avg_violations_weighted): for coloring the points according the pal_num() palette we created on the avg_violations_weighted variable\n~pal_bin(avg_violations_weighted): for coloring the points according the pal_bin() palette we created on the avg_violations_weighted variable\n~pal_quant(avg_violations_weighted): for coloring the points according the pal_quant palette we created on the avg_violations_weighted() variable\n\nYour maps should look like mine below.\n\n\n# Copy map first time here!\n\n# Copy map second time here!\n\n# Copy map third time here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nIn a comment below, explain the following: Why do the colors appear differently on each map? Which map best represents the distribution of values in avg_violations_weighted?\n\n\n# Add comment here. \n\n\n\n\nSizing the Circles\n\nQuestion\n\nCopy and paste the code from above that colors avg_violations_weighted in bins into the code chunk below. We are going to size each circle by the number of rental units in that property. Number of units is stored in the column legalclassa in our dataset, so we could size the circles by setting the radius to ~legalclassa. However, this would lead to some massive circles on our map as certain buildings have hundreds of units, and the value we supply to radius will determine the pixels of the circle on our map. To deal with this, we are going to take the square root of the units in each property using the sqrt() function. Set the radius to ~sqrt(legalclassa) below.\n\n\n# Copy map colored by bins here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegends and Labels\n\nQuestion\n\nAs a final step, we are going to add labels and legends to the map. Copy and paste the code from the previous step into the code chunk below. Then do the following:\n\nAdd the label argument to the addCircleMarkers() function, and set the value to the column in our dataset that indicates the landlord’s full name: ~fullname. Run the code and check what happens when we hover over the circles.\nAdd a pipe to the end of the addCircleMarkers() and then add the function addLegend(). Consult the help pages for the addLegend() function to determine how to add a legend for the meaning of the colors represented on the map. At the very least, you will need an argument for data, pal, and values.\n\n\n\n# Copy previous map here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthical Considerations\n\n\n\nThe NYC Worst Landlord Watchlist determines worst landlords based on class B and C Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) violations. …but not every issue a tenant faces with respect to their landlord will be documented via an HPD violation. What kinds of issues might go ignored when we use these variables alone to determine worst landlords? How should we as data scientists communicate what this data shows and doesn’t show?

    "section": "Interpreting Error Messages",
    "text": "Interpreting Error Messages\nThroughout this week, we have taken a look at different error messages that R presents when it can’t evaluate our code. Today, we will consider these in more detail. First, it’s important to make some distinctions between the kinds of messages that R presents to us when attempting to run code:\n\nErrors\n\nTerminate a process that we are trying to run in R. They arise when it is not possible for R to continue evaluating a function.\n\nWarnings\n\nDon’t terminate a process but are meant to warn us that there may be an issue with our code and its output. They arise when R recognizes potential problems with the code we’ve supplied.\n\nMessages\n\nAlso don’t terminate a process and don’t necessarily indicate a problem but simply provide us with more potentially helpful information about the code we’ve supplied.\n\n\nCheck out the differences between an error and a warning in R by reviewing the output in the Console when you run the following code chunks.\n\nError in R\n\nsum(\"3\", \"4\")\n\nError in sum(\"3\", \"4\"): invalid 'type' (character) of argument\n\n\n\n\nWarning in R\n\nvector1 &lt;- 1:5\nvector2 &lt;- 3:6\nvector1 + vector2\n\nWarning in vector1 + vector2: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter\nobject length\n\n\n[1]  4  6  8 10  8\n\n\nSo what should you do when you get an error message? How should you interpret it? Luckily, there are some clues and standardized components of the message the indicate why R can’t execute the code. Consider the following error message that you received when running the code above:\nError in sum(“3”, “4”) : invalid ‘type’ (character) of argument\nThere are three things we should pay attention to in this message:\n\nThe word “Error” indicates that this code did not run.\nThe text immediately after the word “in” tells us which specific function did not run.\nThe text after the colon gives us clues as why the code did not run.\n\nReviewing the error above, I can guess that there was a problem with the argument that I supplied to the sum() function, and specifically that I supplied a function of the wrong type.\n\nQuestion\n\nRun the codes below and check out the error messages. Review the code to fix each of the errors. Note that each subsequent code chunk relies on the previous code chunk, so you will need to fix the errors in order and run the chunks in order.\n\n\n# Create three vectors\na &lt;- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nb &lt;- \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"\nc &lt;- TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE\n\nError: &lt;text&gt;:2:7: unexpected ','\n1: # Create three vectors\n2: a &lt;- 1,\n         ^\n\n\n\n# Add the values in the vector a\na_added &lt;- add(a)\n\nError in add(a): could not find function \"add\"\n\n\n\n# Multiply the previous output by 3\nthree_times_a_added &lt;- added_a * 3\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'added_a' not found\n\n\n\n# Create a dataframe with col1 and col2\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  col1 = c(1, 2, 3)\n  col2 = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\n\nError: &lt;text&gt;:4:3: unexpected symbol\n3:   col1 = c(1, 2, 3)\n4:   col2\n     ^\n\n\n\n# Add a new column to df\ndf$col3 &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE)\n\nError in df$col3 &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE): object of type 'closure' is not subsettable"

    "section": "Preparing to Get Help",
    "text": "Preparing to Get Help\nWhen we do get errors in our code and need to ask for help in interpreting them, it’s important to provide collaborators with the information they need to help us. Sometimes when teaching R I will hear things like: “My code doesn’t work!” or “I’m stuck and don’t know what to do,” and it can be challenging to suss out the root of the issue without more information. Here are some strategies for describing issues you are having with your code:\n\nReference line numbers. Notice the left side of your template document has a series of numbers listed vertically next to each line? These are known as line numbers. Oftentimes, if you are having an issue with your code and ask me to review it, I will say something like: “Check out line 53.” By this I mean that you should scroll the document to the 53rd line. You can similarly tell me or your peers which line of your code you are struggling with.\nCompose good reproducible examples. A good reproducible example includes all of the lines of code that we need to reproduce an output on our own machines. This means that if you create a vector in a previous code snippet and then supply it as an argument in another code snippet, you are going to want to make sure that both of these lines of code appear in your reproducible example. Further, if the functions that you are using are from certain packages, you will want to make sure the library() call to load that package is in your reproducible example.\nUse the code and code block buttons in Slack to share example code. Certain characters like quotation marks and apostrophes are treated differently across RStudio and Slack. This is because these programs encode characters differently. For example, run the code chunk below and check out the output in your Console. The first line of code I typed directly into RStudio. The second I copied over from Slack.\n\n\n# typed directly into RStudio\ntoupper(\"apple\")\n# copied from Slack\ntoupper(“apple”)\n\nError: &lt;text&gt;:4:9: unexpected invalid token\n3: # copied from Slack\n4: toupper(“\n           ^\n\n\nNotice the slight differences in the shape of the quotation marks? R recognizes the first but doesn’t recognize the second, even though I used the same keyboard key to create both. This is due to the fact that these two systems use different character encodings.\nThe Code button (for a single line of code) and Code Block button (for multiple lines of code) in Slack are useful tools for composing code and avoiding character encoding issues. If you click these buttons when typing a Slack message, you can enter code in the red outlined box that appears, and this will easily copy to RStudio. I will ask you to always use these features when copying code this semester.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn Slack, you can also wrap text backticks (` `) to have it output in a single-line code block, and three backticks (``` ```) to have it output as a multi-line code block.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCopy and paste one line of code from this lab as a threaded comment on the Slack message I posted on September 7, 2022. Be sure the text is formatted as code."

We can access the help pages for a function by typing the name of the function with a question mark in front of it into our Console (e.g. ?log or ?sum).

    "text": "Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA)\nIn the United States, homeownership can offer a pathway to promoting stability and social mobility. However, historically, opportunities for purchasing a home have been unequally distributed along racial and ethnic lines. In a practice known as redlining, some banks in the mid-twentieth century would make decisions about who would be approved for loans based on the perceived “riskiness” of the neighborhoods they lived in; risk was often determined by the racial makeup of the neighborhood. This discrimination in lending enforced the racial segregation of communities and made it much more difficult for Black and other minority individuals to secure access to a financial asset that could be passed down in their families. With limited access to this opportunity for securing generational wealth, we still feel the affects of redlining today - even though racially-motivated redlining was prohibited by the Fair Housing Act in 1968.\nIn order to monitor for fair lending practices, in 1975, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act was passed, requiring lending institutions to publicly disclose data about their lending - reporting each loan application they receive, whether the loan was approved or denied, and demographic information on the borrowers. This data is currently published annually by the Consumer Federal Protection Bureau, and a number of organizations monitor it to determine if there are continued forms of racial discrimination in who has access to home loans.\nIn this lab, we are going to examine Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data from 2024 in Mississippi. Recently, a study by Lending Tree showed that Black homebuyers in Mississippi face some of the highest loan denial rates in the country:\n\n\nEach row in this dataset is one mortgage application, and variables describing the demographics of the applicant, details about the loan, and whether or not the loan was approved are included in the data. When denied, the reasons for denial are also included. For consistency in comparisons, I’ve filtered this dataset down to only include 30-year conventional, first-lien, single-family, non-commercial loans that are either for a home purchase or a home improvement. The data documentation for this dataset is quite thick, so I will provide you with a data dictionary for today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVARIABLE NAME\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\n\n\nderived_ethnicity\nSingle aggregated ethnicity categorization derived from applicant/borrower and co-applicant/co-borrower ethnicity fields\n\n\nderived_race\nSingle aggregated race categorization derived from applicant/borrower and co-applicant/co-borrower race fields\n\n\nderived_sex\nSingle aggregated sex categorization derived from applicant/borrower and co-applicant/co-borrower sex fields\n\n\naction_taken\nThe action taken on the covered loan or application\n\n\nloan_purpose\nThe purpose of covered loan or application\n\n\nloan_amount\nThe amount of the covered loan, or the amount applied for\n\n\nloan_to_value_ratio\nThe ratio of the total amount of debt secured by the property to the value of the property relied on in making the credit decision\n\n\nincome\nThe gross annual income, in thousands of dollars, relied on in making the credit decision, or if a credit decision was not made, the gross annual income relied on in processing the application\n\n\ndebt_to_income_ratio\nThe ratio, as a percentage, of the applicant’s or borrower’s total monthly debt to the total monthly income relied on in making the credit decision\n\n\ntract_minority_population_percent\nPercentage of minority population to total population for tract, rounded to two decimal places\n\n\ndenial_reason\nThe principal reason, or reasons, for denial"

Specifically, we are going to produce data visualizations that count the number of observations in a dataset that fall into specific groupings. When grouping observations by a categorical variable, we will produce a bar plot. Remember when labeling that these plots visualize frequency. They use the height aesthetic to visualize us how many rows in a variable have a certain value.\nLet’s start by comparing how many home loans were for home purchases vs. the number for home improvements.\n\nQuestion\n\nIn the code below, determine the variable that should appear on the x-axis, along with the geom function that can be used to create a bar plot. Fill in the blanks to ensure your plot has the appropriate context.\n\n\nhmda_ms_2024 |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = _____)) +\n  _____() +\n  labs(title = \"Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Applications, [FILL GEOGRAPHY], [FILL YEAR]\",\n       x = \"[FILL X-AXIS VARIABLE]\",\n       y = \"Count of [FILL WHAT's BEING COUNTED?]\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\nNow let’s look at the number of applicants of each race.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCreate a plot below that counts the number of applicants of each race. Be sure to give it a descriptive title and labels covering all 5 essential components of data context. You can use the code you wrote above as a template to get you started. You’ll probably notice that the labels of your plot overlap. You can add + coord_flip() to the end of your code to flip the plot so that the bars are horizontal rather than vertical. This should help with legibility.\n\n\n# Create plot here\n\n\n\nIn the last plot, we visualized the frequency of a categorical variable. When grouping observations into intervals of a numeric variable, we will produce a histogram. For instance, let’s say we want to know the distribution of loan amounts that applicants requested in Mississippi in 2024. With a histogram, I can visualize how many loan applications requested $0-$100000, &gt;$100000-$200000, and so on. Histograms use the height aesthetic to visualize how many rows in a variable fall into each of these numeric bins.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nIn the code below, determine the variable that should appear on the x-axis, along with the geom function that can be used to create a histogram. Set the binwidth to create numeric intervals of 100000. Fill in the blanks to ensure your plot has the appropriate context.\n\n\nhmda_ms_2024  |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = _____)) +\n  _____(binwidth = _____) +\n  labs(title = \"Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Applications, [FILL GEOGRAPHY], [FILL YEAR]\",\n       x = \"[FILL X-AXIS VARIABLE]\",\n       y = \"Count of [FILL WHAT's BEING COUNTED?]\",\n       caption = str_wrap(\"This histogram displays the distribution of home loan amounts requested by Mississippi applicants in 2024. The plot shows that the majority of applicants requested loans under $250,000. Since the average home loan size in the U.S. in 2024 was $252,505, this indicates that average requested home loan sizes in MS were smaller in comparison to the country as a whole.\", 120)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA good plot caption does three things. First, it describes what the plot is and the variables displayed on it. Second, it articulates at least one fact from the plot. Third, it interprets the significance of that fact. The caption that I provided for the last plot follows this template:\n(describe) This histogram displays the distribution of home loan amounts requested by Mississippi applicants in 2024. (articulate fact) The plot shows that the majority of applicants requested loans under $250,000. (interpret significance) Since the average home loan size in the U.S. in 2024 was $252,505, this indicates that average requested home loan sizes in MS were smaller in comparison to the country as a whole.\n\n\nLoan to value ratio is a measure that indicates the percentage of a property’s value that a borrower requests of a lending institution. So let’s say I want to buy a property with a value of $100,000; I plan to put down $20,000, and I request a loan for $80,000. The loan to value ratio would be 80. Typically, when borrowers can put more down, it is considered a less risky loan.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCreate a plot below that shows the distribution of loan to value ratios (in intervals of 10). Be sure to give it a descriptive title and labels covering all 5 essential components of data context. Also add a caption to describe the percentage of a loan’s property that borrowers most often request when applying for a loan.\nYou can use the code you wrote above as a template to get you started. Note that there were 20 outlier loans where borrowers requested more than double property’s value. There was even one loan where the applicant requested 14 times the property’s value. All of these loans were denied. Below I’ve given you some code to filter out these outliers in order to make the plot more legible.\n\n\nhmda_ms_2024 |&gt;\n  filter(loan_to_value_ratio &lt; 200) |&gt;\n# Fill remaining lines here\n\n\n\nLet’s move on to some multivariate plotting. Remember that we can add further variables to a plot via a number of different aesthetics (e.g. color: fill= or col=; size: size=; position: x= or y=, small multiples: + facet_wrap(vars(...)) ). Whenever we add further data to a plot, we should be on the lookout for overplotting.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCreate a stacked barplot below that counts both the race of the applicants and the action taken in regards to the loan. Be sure to give it a descriptive title and labels covering all 5 essential components of data context. I’ve given you some code below to move the legend to the bottom of the plot, to reduce the legend size, and to set the number of rows that appear in the legend.\n\n\nhmda_ms_2024 |&gt;\n# Fill remaining lines here\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 6), \n        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n        legend.key.size = unit(0.4, \"cm\")) +\n  guides(fill=guide_legend(nrow=4))\n\n\n\nWe learned earlier in this lab that there were more white applicants than applicants of other races applying for loans in Mississippi in 2024. If we only look at counts of approvals or denials then we don’t know if differences in approval numbers are due to disparities in who is getting loans or due to there just being more applicants of a particular race. For this reason, we are more interested in the percentage of approvals for each race and the percentage of denials for each race. This is more comparable across races than counts.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCopy the plot that you created above into the code chunk below, and then adjust the position of the bars to “fill” in order to normalize their height. Add a caption that summarizes your findings.\n\n\n# Create plot here\n\n\n\nNow let’s move on to comparing how requested loan amounts differ across race. To do so, we are going to create a boxplot that compares summary statistics (i.e. minimum, maximum, median, 1st quartile, 3rd quartile, and outliers) of the loan amounts requested by applicants of each race.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nFill in the code below to create a boxplot that visualizes how the distributions of requested loan amounts differed across race. Add a caption that summarizes your findings.\n\n\nhmda_ms_2024 |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = derived_race, __________)) +\n  __________ +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Applications, Mississippi, 2024\",\n       x = \"Race of Applicant\",\n       y = _________,\n       caption = _________) +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\n\nIn the past several exercises, we have been creating plots that count the number of rows in a variable have a certain value. …but what if our dataset presents aggregated data - where those counts have already been given to us? For instance, I wrote some code below to create a dataset where the counts of individuals of each race that were denied loans is already calculated, along with the percentage of individuals that were denied loans. I also created a dataset where the counts of individuals of each race and sex that were denied loans is already calculated, along with the percentage. You’ll learn more about these functions in a few weeks. Take a look at these datasets below, and consider how they compare them to the data that we started with.\n\nhmda_denial_by_race &lt;-\n  hmda_ms_2024 |&gt;\n  group_by(derived_race) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_denied = sum(action_taken == \"Application denied\"),\n            percent_denied = sum(action_taken == \"Application denied\")/n())\n\nhmda_denial_by_race_sex &lt;-\n  hmda_ms_2024 |&gt;\n  filter(derived_race != \"Free Form Text Only\") |&gt; #There were only 3 denials with free form text for race in MS in 2024, and they have been removed here for plot legibility\n  group_by(derived_race, derived_sex) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_denied = sum(action_taken == \"Application denied\"),\n            percent_denied = sum(action_taken == \"Application denied\")/n())\n\nhmda_denial_by_race\n\n\n  \n\n\nhmda_denial_by_race_sex\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen counts have already been calculated for us, we need to use a different type of plot to visualize these counts. We don’t need the plot function to count the rows with each value; we just need it to set the height of the bar to a numeric value provided in our dataset. We will create column plots below to do this.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nIn the code below, fill in the blanks to set the height of each bar to the percent of individuals in a particular race whose mortgage was denied. Select a geom function to create a column chart. Be sure to fill in the correct labels.\n\n\nhmda_denial_by_race |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = derived_race, _______)) +\n  _______ +\n  labs(title = \"Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Applications, Mississippi, 2024\",\n       x = \"Race of Applicant\",\n       y = \"___________\",\n       caption = str_wrap(\"This column plot visualizes the denial rates of home mortgage applications in MS in 2024. The plot shows that Black or African American applicants, American Indian or Alaska Native applicants, or applicants of 2 or more minority races were all denied mortgage at double the rate of White applicants. This may indicate disparities in lending practices.\", 120)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\nWhile this gives us some insight into disparities in lending practices, we can’t see how multiple aspects of a person’s identity might factor in to these distinctions. The concept of intersectionality - introduced by civil rights scholar Kimberle Crenshaw in the late 1980s - considers how people of certain overlapping social identities may face unique forms of discrimination. Let’s take a look at how this data changes when we also consider sex in relation to denial rates.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCopy your code above, replacing the hmda_denial_by_race data frame with hmda_denial_by_race_sex. Using the fill aesthetic, add the variable for describing the applicants’ sex to the plot. Set the position of the columns to \"dodge\", and be sure to add a label for the fill aesthetic. Adjust the caption to summarize your findings.\n\n\n# Create plot here\n\n\n\nIn reviewing data like this, some banks have explained the disparities by suggesting that certain groups of applicants are more likely to have lower credit scores, less cash for down payments, or more debt in relation to their income. Let’s take a look at the reasons that Mississippi banks denied mortgage loans in 2024.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCreate a plot below that visualizes how many applicants of each race were denied mortgages for each denial reason. Be sure to give it a descriptive title and labels covering all 5 essential components of data context. You may wish to borrow some of your previous code to adjust the plot for legibility. I’ve given you some code below to filter the data frame to just those mortgage applications that were denied.\n\n\nhmda_ms_2024 |&gt;\n  filter(action_taken == \"Application denied\") |&gt;\n#Fill remaining lines here\n\n\n\nFrom this plot, you should learn that the top three reasons for denials were: 1) Multiple (meaning some combination of other denial reasons), 2) Credit history, and 3) Debt-to-income ratio. This dataset does not release information about applicants’ credit histories. However, we can take a look at the outcomes of applications from applicants with different debt-to-income ratios compared across races.\nDebt-to-income ratio refers to how much debt a person has in relation to the money they earn in income. A high debt-to-income ratio indicates that someone may not be pulling in enough income to pay off their debts, while a low debt-to-income ratio indicates that their income can reasonably help them pay off their debts. Banks are often hesitant to lend to individuals with high debt-to-income ratios.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nBelow I’ve given you some code to produce a plot that visualizes the percent of mortgage applications that resulted in each action (e.g. loan originated, denied, etc.), broken out by the debt-to-income ratio of the applicant. Referring to last week’s lab, add a line to this code to facet this plot by race. For which races was the denial rate higher for applicants with a lower than 50% debt-to-income ratio? Adjust the fact and interpretation presented in the caption with your response.\n\n\nhmda_ms_2024 |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = debt_to_income_ratio, fill = action_taken)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  #Add line to facet here\n  labs(title = \"Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Applications, Mississippi, 2024\",\n       x = \"Debt-to-Income Ratio\",\n       y = \"Percent of Mortgage Applications\",\n       fill = \"Action Taken\", \n       caption = str_wrap(\"This bar plot visualizes the percent of mortgage applications that resulted in each action, broken out by the debt-to-income ratio of the applicant. From this plot, we can see that most applicants with a debt-to-income ratio of 50% or higher were denied loans, and most applicants with a debt-to-income ratio of lower than 50% had their loans originated. This shows that banks are less likely to lend to applicants with higher debt-to-income ratios.\",width = 120)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 8), \n        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n        legend.key.size = unit(0.4, \"cm\"),\n        plot.caption = element_text(size = 8)) +\n  guides(fill=guide_legend(nrow = 3))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s take a look at differences in what borrowers owe when their mortgages are approved. A number of factors influence the interest rates that borrowers pay on their loans (including credit history, income, debt-to-income ratio, and loan term). Higher debt-to-income ratios often result in higher interest rates.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nBelow I’ve given you some code to produce a plot that visualizes how the distributions of interest rates differed across debt-to-income ratios when loans were approved. Referring to last week’s lab, add a line to this code to facet this plot by race. For which races were the interest rates higher even with lower debt-to-income ratios? Adjust the fact and interpretation presented in the caption with your response.\n\n\nhmda_ms_2024 |&gt;\n  filter(action_taken == \"Loan originated\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = debt_to_income_ratio, y = interest_rate)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Applications, Mississippi, 2024\",\n       x = \"Debt-to-Income Ratio\",\n       y = \"Interest Rate\",\n       caption = str_wrap(\"These boxplots visualize the distribution of interest rates for loans originated in MS in 2024, broken out by the debt-to-income ratio of the applicant. From this plot, we can see that the median interest rate for borrowers with a debt-to-income ratio of under 50% was around 7%. Median interest rates increased for borrowers with a debt-to-income ratio of over 50%. This shows that a high debt-to-income ratio may be one factor contributing to higher interest rates.\",width = 120)) +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthical Considerations\n\n\n\nThis dataset makes loan-level data about individual sensitive financial information available to the public. To reduce the risk that borrowers may be identified in the data, the CFPB removes certain variables before publication, such as the loan’s unique identifier, the property address, the applicant’s credit score, and any free-form text that the applicant writes on the application. Applicants do not have the option to opt-out of their data being disclosed in this dataset. If it were possible to re-identify individual applicants in this dataset, what would be the risks to the public disclosure of their information? Which applicants would be the most vulnerable? How should we think about the balance between the social value of this public data disclosure and the possible risks to those represented in it?
