## Activity: Data Science

Form groups of 2-3 with your peers near you. Complete the following tasks:

1. Introduce yourselves to each other! Mention your name, major, and one cool thing you did over the summer.
2. On a piece of paper, write the names of all group members.
3. Write down words, phrases, and ideas that come to mind when you hear "data science".

-   American Civil Liberties Union employs [data scientists](https://medium.com/aclu-tech-analytics/meet-the-aclu-analytics-team-4644d4f20dae) to produce insights regarding discriminatory laws and practices
-   Findings are presented in courts, legislatures, and public reports
-   In [this study](https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice/race-and-economic-justice/lawsuit-challenges-discriminatory-housing-policy), they use public data to show that excluding people with criminal records from housing can be viewed as a violation of the US Fair Housing Act.

## Exercise

On your feet! 

1. Think about how many cups of coffee you had before going into class?
2. Group yourselves based on the number of cups you've had.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Workflow

- Determine problem/issue 
- Collect data
- Explore and clean the data
- Model the data
- Communicate results

**Question?** How was this done? Discuss amongst yourselves.

## Tools

- **Determine problem/issue:** Exploration of issues
- **Collect data:** From online source (e.g. scraping, csv file)
- **Explore and clean the data:** Use of R, wrangling
- **Model the data:** Statistics, regression
- **Communicate results:** Plots, tables, writing, presentations

## Coding: agonizing when it doesn't work, satisfying when it does

- Think of code like a language. 
- Coding can be incredibly frustrating.
- Coding has been exclusionary.
