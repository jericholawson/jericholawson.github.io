Today, we are going to work with a dataset that documents cases where NYC Urban Park Rangers respond to requests for animal assistance, relocation, and/or rescue. If you are unfamiliar with what an Urban Park Ranger does, you may want to check out this video!

1. Navigate to the [NYC Urban Park Ranger Animal Condition Response](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Urban-Park-Ranger-Animal-Condition-Response/fuhs-xmg2) dataset.

2. Note the information listed in the "About this Dataset" section. This is administrative metadata. 

3. Note the attachment in this section with the file name:  `UrbanParkRangerAnimalConditionResponse_DataDictionary_20181107.xlsx`. This contains descriptive metadata for this dataset. 

4. Click on the 'Data' tab at the top of the page. You can now see the data as a rectangular dataset. 

5. Answer the following questions on a sheet of paper in groups of 3-4:
  
  * What is the unit of observation in this dataset? In other words, what does each row signify? How do you know?
  * How frequently is this dataset updated? How do you know?
  * What are the possible values for the Species Status variable in this dataset? How do you know?
  * What is the value at index [3, 3] in this dataset? How do you know?
  * Identify the index of one missing value in this dataset. How do you know?
  * Identify one nominal variable, one ordinal variable, one discrete variable, and one continuous variable. 

6. As a preview of what you will be able to do in a few weeks, here is a visualization of the most commons species for which services are requested in NYC! 
  
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
nyc_urban_ranger <- 
  read_csv("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/fuhs-xmg2/rows.csv",
           name_repair = make.names)

nyc_urban_ranger %>%
  group_by(Species.Description) %>%
  summarize(Count = sum(X..of.Animals)) %>%
  top_n(10, Count) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Species.Description, Count), y = Count)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title="Top 10 Most Common Species for which NYC Urban Park Rangers Assistance is Requested, 2018-2021", x = "Species", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=8))

```
