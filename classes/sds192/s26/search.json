    "text": "Grading and Expectations\n\nBreakdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormative\n\n\nSummative\n\n\n\n\n\nReadings, Activities, Problems\n10%\n\nProjects (2)\n30%\n\n\nLabs\n30%\n\nExams (2)\n30%\n\n\n\nA traditional grading system will be used here. Cumulative numerical averages of 90-100 are guaranteed at least an A-, 80-89 at least a B-, and 70-79 at least a C-. The exact ranges for letter grades will ultimately be determined at the end of the course.\n\n\nMW Classes, Readings, Activties, and Exercises (10%)\nPrior to the upcoming week, readings will be assigned through Perusall that prepare you for material that will be explored thereafter. The readings on Perusall will involve:\n\nReading through the material\nWriting 2-4 annotations\nHighlighting one item you learned and one item that seems challenging\n\nThese annotations will allow me to identify which concepts to focus on in more detail during the week. Generally, these items will be due on Sundays at 11:59pm, with no acceptance of late work. Readings will be graded on completion.\nDuring Mondays and Wednesday classes, we will go through mini-lectures, activities, and demos. Classes will be experiential, meaning that you will have the opportunity to apply concepts from class to activities, exercises, and investigations. Students are expected to participate during lecture by asking questions and working with other students. Additionally, it is required that you bring your laptop to class. Class activities will be administered often during lecture, and you will have until the end of lecture to turn them in through your GitHub submission repository. These activities will be graded based on completion and/or correctness.\nOn occasion, a reading exercise may be assigned on Wednesday for you to complete. Similar to the activities, these will be turned in through your GitHub submission repository by Thursdays at 11:59pm. These exercises will be graded based on completion and correctness.\n\n\nFriday Classes and Labs (30%)\nFriday’s classes are dedicated exclusively to labs unless otherwise stated. In these labs, you will have the opportunity to compile (no pun intended) what you’ve learned and work on a experiential assignment that showcases those skills. This will involve strong usage of R and GitHub. In earlier weeks, we will get you all familiar with the technical programs along with the workflow.\nLabs in this course introduce a data science skill by walking you through exploratory analysis of a dataset documenting a socially-relevant issue (such as racial profiling in policing, affordable housing, and pollution). Labs will be started in class on Fridays and completed for homework by Wednesdays at 11:59pm. If you finish a lab early, you are encouraged to help your classmates. Labs will be graded on both completion and correctness. Note that at the end of each lab, there will be a prompt asking you to consider some of the ethical considerations of the data analysis you just completed. You must respond to this prompt in Slack to earn full credit on the lab.\nAll lab assignments will be submitted through your GitHub submission repository. You will submit assignments by pushing changes to template documents to a private GitHub repository. I will provide guidance on how to do this early in the semester.\n\n\nProjects (30% total)\nTwo projects will be assigned throughout the semester. The projects are designed to test your ability to successfully complete course objectives as described earlier. The following two projects, along with their tentative due dates, are seen below:\n\nProject #1: Data Visualizations and GitHub: due Wednesday, 3/4 at 11:59pm\n\nCreate meaningful, informative, and clear visualizations that communicate information from the data and real-world issue.\nConfigure an appropriate pipeline that funnels all relevant information, files, and summaries into a GitHub repository.\n\nProject #2: Workflow and Real-World Investigation: due Monday, 4/27 at 11:59pm\n\nComplete a detailed, attentive workflow of an investigation related to a real-world issue with appropriate data and context.\nPresent relevant information and code to various audiences in multiple formats, including a report, presentation, and demonstration.\n\n\nMore details to come in later weeks.\n\n\nExams (30% total)\nTwo exams will be administered during the course of the semester, which will include written and oral parts. The first exam will be administered in-class on Friday, 3/13, while the second exam will be administered during finals week as a self-scheduled exam. More details to come in later weeks."

    "section": "Policies",
    "text": "Policies\n\nPreparation and Attendance\nAs a four-credit course that meets 4.5 hours per week, Smith expects students to dedicate at least 7.5 hours per week towards the course outside of class. The assignments, readings, and assessments are designed with this target in mind. Expect to read through lecture notes, examples, articles, and forums outside of class along with the assignments.\nAttending class is imperative to your learning and taking part in an active community. Attendance will be taken for each class period. However, things come up and you may not have the capacity to attend. As such, you will be able to miss 3 classes with no penalty. After the third unexcused absence, your overall grade will drop by 1% for each class missed. Additional absences may be excused due to family/personal difficulties, sickness, or school or career-related activities; however, I will require some form of documentation for these absences. Please speak with your class dean or the Accessibility Resource Center so that we can get documentation of your need.\nDo make every effort to arrive to class on time. If you happen/plan to arrive more than 10 minutes late, please inform me ahead of time. Any unexplained tardiness will result in a marked absence. If you must miss a class entirely, you should contact a peer to discuss what was missed.\n\n\nExtensions\nYou will be granted 2 free late days to use for lab assignments, with a maximum of one day used on each lab assignment. Additionally, you will be granted 2 late days to use for final project submissions, with a maximum of two days used at a single time. No need to inform me that you intend to take these late days. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted without an accommodation from a class dean or from the ARC.\nNote that this policy does not apply to Perusall annotations, reading exercises, exams, or project checkpoints/proposals/presentations.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\nAs a student at Smith College, the college expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in preparation and submission of all course work and examinations, as outlined by the Academic Integrity Board (AIB). The AIB provides an Academic Integrity Statement, which all students are expected to abide by. Any cases of academic dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of these behaviors include:\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as ChatGPT without permission or instruction to do so.\n\nYou are encouraged to discuss course material, including assignments, with your classmates. All work you turn in, however, must be your own. This includes both writing and code. Copying from other students, from books, or from websites (1) does nothing to help you learn how to program, (2) is easy for us to detect, and (3) has serious negative consequences.\n\n\nGenerative AI\nAs mentioned in the Academic Integrity Board, the professor for each course decides whether and how students are allowed to use generative AI in a given course. For this specific course, any use of generative AI to complete assignments or produce content for this course is prohibited, unless otherwise stated in the assignment itself.\nAs a foundational course, it is critical that you are able to think like a data scientist, which includes producing meaningful code, developing logical solutions to problem, and critiquing good results from the bad ones. While the use of generative AI can be beneficial at producing base-level code and providing insights, it comes at the detriment of your own critical thinking. The human element will be critical in succeeding in data science. If you don’t develop the skills to understand how the underlying code is composed/works, then you will not be prepared for this kind of work.\nProhibited forms of generative AI usage include but are not limited to:\n\nSummarizing course readings.\nDrafting, editing, and proofreading responses to written prompts on any assignment.\nComposing and/or formatting code and comments.\nAnswering lab, quiz, or exam questions.\nConducting analysis of any plots, methods, and results for any assignment.\n\nAny unauthorized use of generative artificial intelligence in this course will be considered a case of academic dishonesty/plagiarism and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.\nCaveat: While the policy here is strict, do note that there will be assignments and lectures that go through the ethical and effective use of generative AI in data science as part of a unit. In these assignments, further directions will be given to showcase the use of generative AI. However, unless otherwise stated, generative AI should not be used in any assignment."

    "text": "Community & Support\n\nCode of Conduct\nAs the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack. This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nPrinciples of Community\nWhether in a class, college, or neighborhood setting, achieving a warm community is essential to your well-being. In this class, I hope we can foster a collaborative and welcoming environment: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities.\nTo establish this, consider the following:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge what we do and don’t know, as well as how our colleagues experience the world.\nSupport colleagues that may be stepping outside of their comfort zone (i.e. presentations).\nAsk questions often in our Slack workspace. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nAdmit mistakes. They happen, and I will certainly make mistakes in class.\nUse pronouns. This provides a foundation to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a sense of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\nAccommodations\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact the Accessibility Resource Center in College Hall 104 or at arc@smith.edu. The Center will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ARC, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nStudent Well-Being\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center.\nAdditional resources and support offered by the college are listed below:\n\nAccessibility Resource Center (ARC)\nSpinelli Center: Support for students doing quantitative work. Includes tutoring and resources.\n\nFor this class: Sun-Thurs, 7-9pm in Sabin-Reed 301.\nEmail qlctutor@smith.edu for specific request for help.\n\nCrisis Resources\nCounseling Services\nWellness Resources\nGender Identity and Expression\nDiscriminatory Harassment"

This course will introduce you to concepts and methods from the field of data science, along with how to apply them in R. You will learn how to acquire, clean, wrangle, and visualize data. You will also learn best practices in data science workflows, such as code documentation and version control. Issues in data ethics will be addressed throughout the course.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to do the following:\n\nData visualization: Create informative and clean visuals through various types of plots. Appropriate statistics and metrics are displayed. Use of base R and advanced libraries to generate plots (i.e. ggplot2).\nData wrangling: Develop techniques to properly use data in a workflow, which includes the transformation of data, data cleaning, and data joining. Students will also gather data in appropriate and ethical manners.\nWorkflow: Practice common tasks to working through particular data science problems, such as data retrieval, R programming, GitHub, and light statistics.\nData ethics: Identify best practices and ethical dilemmas that stem from data science work. This includes contextual thinking, environmental concerns, and intellectual property. Students will also develop ethical ways to use generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaumer, B. S., Kaplan, D.

This course will introduce you to concepts and methods from the field of data science, along with how to apply them in R. You will learn how to acquire, clean, wrangle, and visualize data. You will also learn best practices in data science workflows, such as code documentation and version control. Issues in data ethics will be addressed throughout the course.\n\n\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to do the following:\n\nData visualization: Create informative and clean visuals through various types of plots. Appropriate statistics and metrics are displayed. Use of base R and advanced libraries to generate plots (i.e. ggplot2).\nData wrangling: Develop techniques to properly use data in a workflow, which includes the transformation of data, data cleaning, and data joining. Students will also gather data in appropriate and ethical manners.\nWorkflow: Practice common tasks to working through particular data science problems, such as data retrieval, R programming, GitHub, and light statistics.\nData ethics: Identify best practices and ethical dilemmas that stem from data science work. This includes contextual thinking, environmental concerns, and intellectual property. Students will also develop ethical ways to use generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaumer, B. S., Kaplan, D.

    "text": "Grading and Expectations\n\nBreakdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormative\n\n\nSummative\n\n\n\n\n\nReadings, Activities, Problems\n10%\n\nProjects (2)\n30%\n\n\nLabs\n30%\n\nExams (2)\n30%\n\n\n\nA traditional grading system will be used here. Cumulative numerical averages of 90-100 are guaranteed at least an A-, 80-89 at least a B-, and 70-79 at least a C-. The exact ranges for letter grades will ultimately be determined at the end of the course.\n\n\nMW Classes, Readings, Activties, and Exercises (10%)\nPrior to the upcoming week, readings will be assigned through Perusall that prepare you for material that will be explored thereafter. The readings on Perusall will involve:\n\nReading through the material\nWriting 2-4 annotations\nHighlighting one item you learned and one item that seems challenging\n\nThese annotations will allow me to identify which concepts to focus on in more detail during the week. Generally, these items will be due on Sundays at 11:59pm, with no acceptance of late work. Readings will be graded on completion.\nDuring Mondays and Wednesday classes, we will go through mini-lectures, activities, and demos. Classes will be experiential, meaning that you will have the opportunity to apply concepts from class to activities, exercises, and investigations. Students are expected to participate during lecture by asking questions and working with other students. Additionally, it is required that you bring your laptop to class. Class activities will be administered often during lecture, and you will have until the end of lecture to turn them in through your GitHub submission repository. These activities will be graded based on completion and/or correctness.\nOn occasion, a reading exercise may be assigned on Wednesday for you to complete. Similar to the activities, these will be turned in through your GitHub submission repository by Thursdays at 11:59pm. These exercises will be graded based on completion and correctness.\n\n\nFriday Classes and Labs (30%)\nFriday’s classes are dedicated exclusively to labs unless otherwise stated. In these labs, you will have the opportunity to compile (no pun intended) what you’ve learned and work on a experiential assignment that showcases those skills. This will involve strong usage of R and GitHub. In earlier weeks, we will get you all familiar with the technical programs along with the workflow.\nLabs in this course introduce a data science skill by walking you through exploratory analysis of a dataset documenting a socially-relevant issue (such as racial profiling in policing, affordable housing, and pollution). Labs will be started in class on Fridays and completed for homework by Wednesdays at 11:59pm. If you finish a lab early, you are encouraged to help your classmates. Labs will be graded on both completion and correctness. Note that at the end of each lab, there will be a prompt asking you to consider some of the ethical considerations of the data analysis you just completed. You must respond to this prompt in Slack to earn full credit on the lab.\nAll lab assignments will be submitted through your GitHub submission repository. You will submit assignments by pushing changes to template documents to a private GitHub repository. I will provide guidance on how to do this early in the semester.\n\n\nProjects (30% total)\nTwo projects will be assigned throughout the semester. The projects are designed to test your ability to successfully complete course objectives as described earlier. The following two projects, along with their tentative due dates, are seen below:\n\nProject #1: Data Visualizations and GitHub: due Wednesday, 3/4 at 11:59pm\n\nCreate meaningful, informative, and clear visualizations that communicate information from the data and real-world issue.\nConfigure an appropriate pipeline that funnels all relevant information, files, and summaries into a GitHub repository.\n\nProject #2: Workflow and Real-World Investigation: due Monday, 4/27 at 11:59pm\n\nComplete a detailed, attentive workflow of an investigation related to a real-world issue with appropriate data and context.\nPresent relevant information and code to various audiences in multiple formats, including a report, presentation, and demonstration.\n\n\nMore details to come in later weeks.\n\n\nExams (30% total)\nTwo exams will be administered during the course of the semester, which will include written and oral parts. The first exam will be administered in-class on Friday, 3/13, while the second exam will be administered during finals week as a self-scheduled exam. More details to come in later weeks."

    "section": "Policies",
    "text": "Policies\n\nPreparation and Attendance\nAs a four-credit course that meets 4.5 hours per week, Smith expects students to dedicate at least 7.5 hours per week towards the course outside of class. The assignments, readings, and assessments are designed with this target in mind. Expect to read through lecture notes, examples, articles, and forums outside of class along with the assignments.\nAttending class is imperative to your learning and taking part in an active community. Attendance will be taken for each class period. However, things come up and you may not have the capacity to attend. As such, you will be able to miss 3 classes with no penalty. After the third unexcused absence, your overall grade will drop by 1% for each class missed. Additional absences may be excused due to family/personal difficulties, sickness, or school or career-related activities; however, I will require some form of documentation for these absences. Please speak with your class dean or the Accessibility Resource Center so that we can get documentation of your need.\nDo make every effort to arrive to class on time. If you happen/plan to arrive more than 10 minutes late, please inform me ahead of time. Any unexplained tardiness will result in a marked absence. If you must miss a class entirely, you should contact a peer to discuss what was missed.\n\n\nExtensions\nYou will be granted 2 free late days to use for lab assignments, with a maximum of one day used on each lab assignment. Additionally, you will be granted 2 late days to use for final project submissions, with a maximum of two days used at a single time. No need to inform me that you intend to take these late days. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted without an accommodation from a class dean or from the ARC.\nNote that this policy does not apply to Perusall annotations, reading exercises, exams, or project checkpoints/proposals/presentations.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\nAs a student at Smith College, the college expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in preparation and submission of all course work and examinations, as outlined by the Academic Integrity Board (AIB). The AIB provides an Academic Integrity Statement, which all students are expected to abide by. Any cases of academic dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of these behaviors include:\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as ChatGPT without permission or instruction to do so.\n\nYou are encouraged to discuss course material, including assignments, with your classmates. All work you turn in, however, must be your own. This includes both writing and code. Copying from other students, from books, or from websites (1) does nothing to help you learn how to program, (2) is easy for us to detect, and (3) has serious negative consequences.\n\n\nGenerative AI\nAs mentioned in the Academic Integrity Board, the professor for each course decides whether and how students are allowed to use generative AI in a given course. For this specific course, any use of generative AI to complete assignments or produce content for this course is prohibited, unless otherwise stated in the assignment itself.\nAs a foundational course, it is critical that you are able to think like a data scientist, which includes producing meaningful code, developing logical solutions to problem, and critiquing good results from the bad ones. While the use of generative AI can be beneficial at producing base-level code and providing insights, it comes at the detriment of your own critical thinking. The human element will be critical in succeeding in data science. If you don’t develop the skills to understand how the underlying code is composed/works, then you will not be prepared for this kind of work.\nProhibited forms of generative AI usage include but are not limited to:\n\nSummarizing course readings.\nDrafting, editing, and proofreading responses to written prompts on any assignment.\nComposing and/or formatting code and comments.\nAnswering lab, quiz, or exam questions.\nConducting analysis of any plots, methods, and results for any assignment.\n\nAny unauthorized use of generative artificial intelligence in this course will be considered a case of academic dishonesty/plagiarism and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.\nCaveat: While the policy here is strict, do note that there will be assignments and lectures that go through the ethical and effective use of generative AI in data science as part of a unit. In these assignments, further directions will be given to showcase the use of generative AI. However, unless otherwise stated, generative AI should not be used in any assignment."

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack. This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nPrinciples of Community\nWhether in a class, college, or neighborhood setting, achieving a warm community is essential to your well-being. In this class, I hope we can foster a collaborative and welcoming environment: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities.\nTo establish this, consider the following:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge what we do and don’t know, as well as how our colleagues experience the world.\nSupport colleagues that may be stepping outside of their comfort zone (i.e. presentations).\nAsk questions often in our Slack workspace. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nAdmit mistakes. They happen, and I will certainly make mistakes in class.\nUse pronouns. This provides a foundation to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a sense of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\nAccommodations\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact the Accessibility Resource Center in College Hall 104 or at arc@smith.edu. The Center will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ARC, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nStudent Well-Being\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center.\nAdditional resources and support offered by the college are listed below:\n\nAccessibility Resource Center (ARC)\nSpinelli Center: Support for students doing quantitative work. Includes tutoring and resources.\n\nFor this class: Sun-Thurs, 7-9pm in Sabin-Reed 301.\nEmail qlctutor@smith.edu for specific request for help.\n\nCrisis Resources\nCounseling Services\nWellness Resources\nGender Identity and Expression\nDiscriminatory Harassment"

R is the coding language that many statisticians and data scientists use to generate data visualizations, complete data wrangling, and run analyses. RStudio is the application that we use to interact with R, formally known as an IDE (i.e. Integrated Development Environment). We will use RStudio particularly when writing R code and walking through problems.\nWe will need to download and install R and RStudio onto our laptops. If you are running a web-based operating system (e.g. ChromeOS), you will have to use Posit Cloud to run R. Instructions to use Posit Cloud can be seen at the bottom of this section.\nFor everyone else (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux), you will download and install R and RStudio using these instructions:\n\nGo to the following link here.\nInstall R first by clicking on “Download and Install R”, which can be found on the left side of the page.\nYou will be redirected to https://cran.rstudio.com/.\n\nWindows: Click on the link to “Download R for Windows”, choose “install R for the first time”, then choose “Download R 4.5.2 for Windows”.\nMacOS: Click “Download R for (Mac) OS X”. Download the install package for version R-4.5.2. Read the information carefully to determine which of the two versions to download.\nLinux: Click on the link to “Download R for Linux”. You will need to choose the version of Linux that corresponds to your installation. Versions are available for Debian, RedHat, SUSE, and Ubuntu.\n\nOnce the R file has been downloaded, please install R by opening the file. Follow all prompts as necessary, keeping things as defaulted as possible.\nGo back to the Posit webpage and follow step 2 on the page by clicking “Download RStudio Desktop for ____”. Once downloaded, install RStudio by opening the file. Follow all prompts as necessary.\n\nFor those using Posit Cloud:\n\nClick the Login button located at the top-right corner of the screen.\nSign-in using either Google or GitHub.\n\nIf you have trouble installing and downloading R/RStudio, we will have some time at the beginning of the first lab to walk through any issues you all have."

The actions “push”, “pull”, “commit”, and others will pop up and we will discuss these in detail throughout the semester. GitHub refers to the application that utilizes the git system to aid in these processes. GitHub Classroom is a special use of GitHub that will allow for specific repositories to be linked to our classroom.\nA few actions need to happen to set these items up, which you’ll see in the subsections below.\n\nSetting Up Your R Environment\nIf you have any troubles, you can use the Happy Git with R textbook for assistance.\n\nGo to GitHub and create a GitHub account, preferably with your smith.edu account. Setup account details.\nOpen RStudio on your laptop.\nCheck to ensure you have git installed by opening RStudio and clicking on Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Git/SVN tab. Check the top of the pane for a field for the Git executable. It should say something like: “/usr/bin/git” or “C:/Program Files/Git/”. If it says “(Not Found)” git is not installed.\nIn the R console (bottom-left corner), you will input and hit Enter for each of these lines of code (replace what it is in the quotations with your info):\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\nlibrary(usethis)\nuse_git_config(user.name = \"PUT GITHUB USERNAME HERE\", user.email = \"PUT GITHUB EMAIL HERE\")\n\n\nPut the following line of code in the console:\n\n\ncreate_github_token()\n\nDefine a name for the token and set the expiration date to be 150 days from today’s date. Leave all other settings the same and generate the token.\nOnce done, please save the token in some fashion. You will not see this token again once you leave the webpage.\n\nReturn to RStudio and run the following lines of code in the console:\n\n\nlibrary(gitcreds)\ngitcreds_set()\n\nWhen prompted for the token, paste the token you created into the console and hit Enter.\nIf you are needing additional assistance, please use the following videos:\n\nConfiguring git\nPersonal Access Token (PAT)\nStoring PAT\n\n\n\nSetting Up GitHub Classroom and Future Repositories\nYour current and future RStudio environments are now linked to your GitHub account, providing you access to repositories on GitHub itself. With this in mind, we can now replicate repositories from GitHub in a process called cloning.\n\nUse the following link below to access the test repository from GitHub Classroom:\n\nhttps://classroom.github.com/a/_arMNRWC\n\n\nYou will go through all necessary prompts. Feel free to use this video as a resource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsQ48kn-uD0\n\nCopy the URL for your SDS 192 Lab GitHub repo. It should look like the following link:\n\nhttps://github.com/sds192lawson/tech-setup-repository-YOUR_USERNAME\n\nGo back to RStudio. At the top-left corner, click on File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; git.\n\nPaste the URL into the first field, type a simple name for the folder in the second field, and choose an appropriate directory on your computer to house the repository. Then, click Create Project.\n\nInstall the rmarkdown package in RStudio by entering the following lines of code in the console.\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\n\n\nOn the initial install, the Files tab will be in the lower right hand corner of RStudio. Open practice.qmd, and then follow the prompts in that file. Click Save.\nWe will now pull, commit, and push changes to the remote repository on GitHub. To do so, go to the Git tab on the top-right corner. From there,\n\nClick on the blue downward arrow, which pulls updates from the remote repository. This ensures we have the most recent updates.\nClick on the stacked checkmark in the same area, which will allow you to commit changes to the remote repository. Stage each file in the left column by clicking on the checkbox and add a message in the right column that briefly specifies what changes you’ve made to the repository. Click Commit thereafter.\nClick on the green upward area, which pushes updates to the remote repository. A window will pop up, showing the status of the push. If successful, you should see those updated files in your GitHub repository. You can use the URL from step 8 to verify.\n\nRepeat steps 7-9 twice, each for the following two repositories you will use for lecture activities and lab assignments respectively:\n\nActivities Repo: https://classroom.github.com/a/V5LWa0K6\nLab Repo: https://classroom.github.com/a/vO0Mut-V\n\n\nIf you are needing additional assistance, please use the following videos:\n\nConfiguring RStudio Projects\nCommitting Files\nPushing Files"
