Cumulative numerical averages of 90-100 are guaranteed at least an A-, 80-89 at least a B-, and 70-79 at least a C-. The exact ranges for letter grades will ultimately be determined at the end of the course.\n\n\n\nEach class will consist of some form of the following: mini-lectures, demos, exercises, quizzes, discussions, and package work time. Expect an experiential environment, where you will be working with code and concepts during the classes. As such, each student must bring their laptop to class.\nStudents are expected to participate during lecture by asking questions and working with other students. In-class activities will be submitted by the end of class through a GitHub repository and are graded for completion and accuracy. To complete these in-class activities, it is required that you show up for class unless extenuating circumstances apply.\nWeekly readings will be assigned to prepare you for content that will be talked about in class. Even though there will be no grade associated with these readings, it is strongly recommended to come to the following week’s classes with these readings completed.\n\n\n\nProblem sets will be assigned bi-weekly to provide practice related to the current topics. These problems will involve conceptual exploration of topics, as well as solving through extended problems that tie in multiple topics at once.\nSimilar to the in-class activities, the problem sets will be turned in through a GitHub repository. Questions are graded based on accuracy.\nGrade drop: Your lowest problem set grade will be dropped from your problem set total.\n\n\n\nTwo exams will be given out in-class to demonstrate your knowledge on the course content. The first exam will be a closed-note written exam, while the second exam will be an open-note, open-laptop exam.\nExpect questions to be similar in vein to the problem sets.\n\n\n\nThe overall objective of this course is to develop a new R package with a team of your choice. Throughout the second half of the course, you will receive feedback on the functionality, clarity, robustness, and readability of your code and documentation through a series of checkpoints.\nDespite the unique opportunity to create a package in R, it may seem daunting to do so at first. The checkpoints and mini-assignments will pace yourselves as we prepare for the final package. Beneath are the following:\n\nProposal and Help File: due TBD\n\nDevelop a one-page proposal that summarizes the package you want to create and/or modify with appropriate motivations, references, and a course of action.\nCreate a help file on a function that you’ve developed that details what it does, its usage, arguments, values, and examples.\n\nCheckpoint #1: due TBD\n\nDevelop an R package that meets minimum requirements.\n\nCheckpoint #2: due TBD\n\nDevelop an R package that advances on progress from the first checkpoint, including more functions, datasets, and/or descriptions.\n\nRehearsal: given TBD\n\nPrep for demonstration\n\nDemonstration: given in-class on TBD\n\nShowcase and run through a 5-8 minute demonstration on your R package.\n\nWhole package: due TBD\n\nComplete the R package and make any refinements.\n\n\nMore details to come in later weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a four-credit course that meets 4.5 hours per week, Smith College expects students to dedicate at least 7.5 hours per week towards the course outside of class. The assignments, readings, and assessments are designed with this target in mind. Expect to read through lecture notes, examples, articles, and forums outside of class along with the assignments.\n\n\n\n(need to fix)\nYou will be granted 4 late days to use for lab assignments, with a maximum of one day used on each lab assignment. Additionally, you will be granted 4 late days to use for checkpoints during R package development (excluding the demonstration and whole package). No need to inform me that you intend to take these late days. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted without an accommodation from a class dean or from the ARC.\nNote that this policy does not apply to activities, readings, quizzes, or final package/presentation submission.\n\n\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgment of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Any cases of dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as ChatGPT without permission or instruction to do so.\n\nYou are encouraged to discuss course material, including assignments, with your classmates. All work you turn in, however, must be your own. This includes both writing and code. Copying from other students, from books, or from websites (1) does nothing to help you learn how to program, (2) is easy for us to detect, and (3) has serious negative consequences.\n\n\n\n(need to fix)\nAs mentioned in the Academic Integrity Board, the professor for each course decides whether and how students are allowed to use generative AI in a given course. For this specific course, the use of generative AI to complete assignments or produce content for this course is on a assignment-by-assignment basis.\nAs an upper-division course, you have developed skills to code through basic tasks and processes in data science, as well as to analyze particular behaviors and patterns in the results. Generative AI can be useful as a tool to refine material and gather information about particular parts of code; however, the more you rely on AI, the more you lose out on the ability to think like a data scientist. The human element will be critical in succeeding in data science, and as such, appropriate considerations need to be made when using generative AI on assignments.\nSpecifically, here are the following permissions and constraints regarding generative AI on assignments and tasks in this course:\n\nActivities, exercises, and readings: Generative AI can be used for pre-writing activities and code editing. Use of generative AI for writing any length of written content, composing any length of code, or synthesizing content are prohibited. Code and prose should be written in your own style. Any permitted use of generative AI should be cited in areas in which it was used.\nQuizzes: Generative AI is strictly prohibited on all quizzes.\nPackage: Generative AI for use in development of ideas, pre-writing, and structuring is permitted. However, any formal writing of documentation and code is not permitted.\n\nAny unauthorized use of generative artificial intelligence in this course will be considered a case of academic dishonesty/plagiarism and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Some assignments will also contain modifications to these rules, so be mindful of these rules for each assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack. This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\n\nWhether in a class, college, or neighborhood setting, achieving a warm community is essential to your well-being. In this class, I hope we can foster a collaborative and welcoming environment: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities.\nTo establish this, consider the following:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge what we do and don’t know, as well as how our colleagues experience the world.\nSupport colleagues that may be stepping outside of their comfort zone (i.e. presentations).\nAsk questions often in our Slack workspace. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nAdmit mistakes. They happen, and I will certainly make mistakes in class.\nUse pronouns. This provides a foundation to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a sense of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\n\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact the Accessibility Resource Center in College Hall 104 or at arc@smith.edu. The Center will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ARC, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\n\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center.\nAdditional resources and support offered by the college are listed below:\n\nAccessibility Resource Center (ARC)\nSpinelli Center: Support for students doing quantitative work.

Cumulative numerical averages of 90-100 are guaranteed at least an A-, 80-89 at least a B-, and 70-79 at least a C-. The exact ranges for letter grades will ultimately be determined at the end of the course.\n\n\nClasses and In-Class Exercises (10%)\nEach class will consist of some form of the following: mini-lectures, demos, exercises, discussions, and package work time. Expect an experiential environment, where you will be working with code and concepts during the classes. As such, each student must bring their laptop to class.\nStudents are expected to participate during lecture by asking questions and working with other students. In-class activities will be submitted by the end of class through a GitHub repository and are graded for completion and accuracy. To complete these in-class activities, it is required that you show up for class unless extenuating circumstances apply.\nWeekly readings will be assigned to prepare you for content that will be talked about in class. Even though there will be no grade associated with these readings, it is strongly recommended to come to the following week’s classes with these readings completed.\n\n\nProblem Sets (20% total)\nProblem sets will be assigned bi-weekly to provide practice related to the current topics. These problems will involve conceptual exploration of topics, as well as solving through extended problems that tie in multiple topics at once.\nSimilar to the in-class activities, the problem sets will be turned in through a GitHub repository. Questions are graded based on accuracy.\nGrade drop: Your lowest problem set grade will be dropped from your problem set total.\n\n\nExams (30% total)\nTwo exams will be given out in-class to demonstrate your knowledge on the course content. The first exam will be a closed-note written exam, while the second exam will be an open-note, open-laptop exam. These exams may include an oral portion, where you will have to explain particular concepts in a conversation-style setting.\nExpect questions to be similar in vein to the problem sets.\n\n\nPackage (40%)\nThe overall objective of this course is to develop a new R package with a team of your choice. Throughout the second half of the course, you will receive feedback on the functionality, clarity, robustness, and readability of your code and documentation through a series of checkpoints.\nDespite the unique opportunity to create a package in R, it may seem daunting to do so at first. The checkpoints and mini-assignments will pace yourselves as we prepare for the final package. Beneath are the following:\n\nProposal and Outline: due Monday, 3/30 at 11:59pm\n\nDevelop a one-page proposal that summarizes the package you want to create and/or modify with appropriate motivations, references, and a course of action.\nCreate an outline that mimics the potential description file you will ultimately develop.\n\nCheckpoint #1: due Monday, 4/13 at 11:59pm\n\nDevelop an R package that meets minimum requirements.\n\nRehearsal: given during alloted times on Monday, 4/20\n\nPrep for demonstration\n\nCheckpoint #2: due Friday, 4/24 at 11:59pm\n\nDevelop an R package that advances on progress from the first checkpoint, including more functions, datasets, and/or descriptions.\n\nDemonstration: given in-class on Wednesday, 4/29\n\nShowcase and run through a 5-8 minute demonstration on your R package.\n\nWhole package: due Wednesday, 5/6 at 11:59pm\n\nComplete the R package and make any refinements.\n\n\nMore details to come in later weeks."

    "section": "Policies",
    "text": "Policies\n\nPreparation and Attendance\nAs a four-credit course that meets 4.5 hours per week, Smith College expects students to dedicate at least 7.5 hours per week towards the course outside of class. The assignments, readings, and assessments are designed with this target in mind. Expect to read through lecture notes, examples, articles, and forums outside of class along with the assignments.\n\n\nExtensions\nYou will be granted 2 late days to use on problem sets, with a maximum of one day used on each problem set. Additionally, you will be granted 2 late days to use for checkpoints during R package development (excluding the demonstration and whole package). No need to inform me that you intend to take these late days. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted without an accommodation from a class dean or from the ARC.\nNote that this policy does not apply to activities, readings, exams, or final package/presentation submission.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\nAs a student at Smith College, the college expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in preparation and submission of all course work and examinations, as outlined by the Academic Integrity Board (AIB). The AIB provides an Academic Integrity Statement, which all students are expected to abide by. Any cases of academic dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of these behaviors include:\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as ChatGPT without permission or instruction to do so.\n\nYou are encouraged to discuss course material, including assignments, with your classmates. All work you turn in, however, must be your own. This includes both writing and code. Copying from other students, from books, or from websites (1) does nothing to help you learn how to program, (2) is easy for us to detect, and (3) has serious negative consequences.\n\n\nGenerative AI\nAs mentioned in the Academic Integrity Board, the professor for each course decides whether and how students are allowed to use generative AI in a given course. For this specific course, the use of generative AI to complete assignments or produce content for this course is on a assignment-by-assignment basis, but will be strictly prohibited on in-class assignments and any final package submissions (i.e. demonstration, final package).\nAs an upper-division course, you have developed skills to code through basic tasks and processes in data science, as well as to analyze particular behaviors and patterns in the results. Generative AI can be useful as a tool to refine material and gather information about particular parts of code; however, the more you rely on AI, the more you lose out on the ability to think like a data scientist. The human element will be critical in succeeding in data science, and as such, appropriate considerations need to be made when using generative AI on assignments.\nSpecifically, here are the following permissions and constraints regarding generative AI on assignments and tasks in this course:\n\nActivities, problem sets, and readings: Generative AI can be used for pre-writing activities and code editing. Use of generative AI for writing any length of written content, composing any length of code, or synthesizing content are prohibited. Code and prose should be written in your own style. Any permitted use of generative AI should be cited in areas in which it was used.\nExams: Generative AI is strictly prohibited on all exams.\nPackage: Generative AI for use in development of ideas, pre-writing, and structuring is permitted, particularly in the early phases of development. However, any formal writing of documentation and code is not permitted.\n\nAny unauthorized use of generative artificial intelligence in this course will be considered a case of academic dishonesty/plagiarism and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Some assignments will also contain modifications to these rules, so be mindful of these rules for each assignment."

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack. This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nPrinciples of Community\nWhether in a class, college, or neighborhood setting, achieving a warm community is essential to your well-being. In this class, I hope we can foster a collaborative and welcoming environment: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities.\nTo establish this, consider the following:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge what we do and don’t know, as well as how our colleagues experience the world.\nSupport colleagues that may be stepping outside of their comfort zone (i.e. presentations).\nAsk questions often in our Slack workspace. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nAdmit mistakes. They happen, and I will certainly make mistakes in class.\nUse pronouns. This provides a foundation to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a sense of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\nAccommodations\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact the Accessibility Resource Center in College Hall 104 or at arc@smith.edu. The Center will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ARC, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nStudent Well-Being\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center.\nAdditional resources and support offered by the college are listed below:\n\nAccessibility Resource Center (ARC)\nSpinelli Center: Support for students doing quantitative work. Includes tutoring and resources.\n\nFor this class: Sun-Thurs, 7-9pm in Sabin-Reed 301.\nEmail qlctutor@smith.edu for specific request for help.\n\nCrisis Resources\nCounseling Services\nWellness Resources\nGender Identity and Expression\nDiscriminatory Harassment"

Go to the #general channel, go to my “Welcome” post, and reply to the thread with a random fact of your choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional, but recommended: Turn on notifications from this workspace (this should already be toggled, but double-check to be sure.) Also, you may be encouraged to download and install Slack on your laptops and phones."

    "text": "R and RStudio\nR and RStudio will collectively make up the coding tools we will use to run through data science examples and assignments. R is the coding language that many statisticians and data scientists use to generate data visualizations, complete data wrangling, and run analyses. RStudio is the application that we use to interact with R, formally known as an IDE (i.e. Integrated Development Environment). We will use RStudio particularly when writing R code and walking through problems.\nWe will need to download and install R and RStudio onto our laptops. If you are running a web-based operating system (e.g. ChromeOS), you will have to use Posit Cloud to run R. Instructions to use Posit Cloud can be seen at the bottom of this section.\nFor everyone else (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux), you will download and install R and RStudio using these instructions:\n\nGo to the following link here.\nInstall R first by clicking on “Download and Install R”, which can be found on the left side of the page.\nYou will be redirected to https://cran.rstudio.com/.\n\nWindows: Click on the link to “Download R for Windows”, choose “install R for the first time”, then choose “Download R 4.5.2 for Windows”.\nMacOS: Click “Download R for (Mac) OS X”. Download the install package for version R-4.5.2. Read the information carefully to determine which of the two versions to download.\nLinux: Click on the link to “Download R for Linux”. You will need to choose the version of Linux that corresponds to your installation. Versions are available for Debian, RedHat, SUSE, and Ubuntu.\n\nOnce the R file has been downloaded, please install R by opening the file. Follow all prompts as necessary, keeping things as defaulted as possible.\nGo back to the Posit webpage and follow step 2 on the page by clicking “Download RStudio Desktop for ____”. Once downloaded, install RStudio by opening the file. Follow all prompts as necessary.\n\nFor those using Posit Cloud:\n\nClick the Login button located at the top-right corner of the screen.\nSign-in using either Google or GitHub.\n\nIf you have trouble installing and downloading R/RStudio, we will have some time at the beginning of the first lab to walk through any issues you all have."

    "text": "git, GitHub, and GitHub Classroom\nWe will be using git commands, GitHub, and GitHub classroom to collaborate with others on coding and projects, submit coding-relative activities and assignments, and get familiar with data science workflows.\nTo differentiate between the terms, when referring to “git”, this refers to the software and commands associated with tracking changes in files during software development. The actions “push”, “pull”, “commit”, and others will pop up and we will discuss these in detail throughout the semester. GitHub refers to the application that utilizes the git system to aid in these processes. GitHub Classroom is a special use of GitHub that will allow for specific repositories to be linked to our classroom.\nA few actions need to happen to set these items up, which you’ll see in the subsections below.\n\nSetting Up Your R Environment\nIf you have any troubles, you can use the Happy Git with R textbook for assistance.\n\nGo to GitHub and create a GitHub account (if you don’t have one), preferably with your smith.edu account. Setup account details.\nOpen RStudio on your laptop.\nCheck to ensure you have git installed by opening RStudio and clicking on Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Git/SVN tab. Check the top of the pane for a field for the Git executable. It should say something like: “/usr/bin/git” or “C:/Program Files/Git/”. If it says “(Not Found)” git is not installed.\nIn the R console (bottom-left corner), you will input and hit Enter for each of these lines of code (replace what it is in the quotations with your info):\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\nlibrary(usethis)\nuse_git_config(user.name = \"PUT GITHUB USERNAME HERE\", user.email = \"PUT GITHUB EMAIL HERE\")\n\n\nPut the following line of code in the console:\n\n\ncreate_github_token()\n\nDefine a name for the token and set the expiration date to be 150 days from today’s date. Leave all other settings the same and generate the token.\nOnce done, please save the token in some fashion. You will not see this token again once you leave the webpage.\n\nReturn to RStudio and run the following lines of code in the console:\n\n\nlibrary(gitcreds)\ngitcreds_set()\n\nWhen prompted for the token, paste the token you created into the console and hit Enter.\nIf you are needing additional assistance, please use the following videos:\n\nConfiguring git\nPersonal Access Token (PAT)\nStoring PAT\n\n\n\nSetting Up GitHub Classroom and Future Repositories\nYour current and future RStudio environments are now linked to your GitHub account, providing you access to repositories on GitHub itself. With this in mind, we can now replicate repositories from GitHub in a process called cloning.\n\nUse the following link below to access the SDS 270 repository from GitHub Classroom:\n\nhttps://classroom.github.com/a/EHsdPrD4\n\n\nYou will go through all necessary prompts. Feel free to use this video as a resource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsQ48kn-uD0\n7a. You may run into issues with having access to your repository, such as seeing this prompt:\n\nIf you see this prompt, then do the following:\n\nGo back to GitHub and click on the Notifications button located at the top-right corner of the screen.\nFind the invite notification and accept that invitation.\n\nThis should take you to your repo, and you continue on with the setup. If you cannot access the invite still, please message or email me about it.\n\nCopy the URL for your SDS 270 GitHub repo. It should look like the following link:\n\nhttps://github.com/sds270lawson/sds-270-repository-YOUR_USERNAME\n\nGo back to RStudio. At the top-left corner, click on File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; git.\n\nPaste the URL into the first field, type a simple name for the folder in the second field, and choose an appropriate directory on your computer to house the repository. Then, click Create Project.\n\nInstall the rmarkdown package in RStudio by entering the following lines of code in the console.\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\n\n\nOn the initial install, the Files tab will be in the lower right hand corner of RStudio. Open practice.qmd, and then follow the prompts in that file. Click Save.\nWe will now pull, commit, and push changes to the remote repository on GitHub. To do so, go to the Git tab on the top-right corner. From there,\n\nClick on the blue downward arrow, which pulls updates from the remote repository. This ensures we have the most recent updates.\nClick on the stacked checkmark in the same area, which will allow you to commit changes to the remote repository. Stage each file in the left column by clicking on the checkbox and add a message in the right column that briefly specifies what changes you’ve made to the repository. Click Commit thereafter.\nClick on the green upward area, which pushes updates to the remote repository. A window will pop up, showing the status of the push. If successful, you should see those updated files in your GitHub repository. You can use the URL from step 8 to verify.\n\n\nIf you are needing additional assistance, please use the following videos:\n\nConfiguring RStudio Projects\nCommitting Files\nPushing Files"

Then, display only the names of these characters.\n\n# Do not alter code right above.\n\n\n\n\nBase R Subsetting vs. dplyr() functions\nIn many applications, you will find R users that subset through the [], [[]], $ symbols, but unless we know the type and functionality associated with the type, we will run across some errors.\nThe next few exercises will showcase this. You will use the following objects in the next 3 exercises.\n\nnum &lt;- 5\nvar &lt;- \"skin_color\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ3\n\n\n\nUsing starwars, access the 5th column using the num object within the [[]], [] and $ operators.

What do you notice?\n\n# Do not alter code right above.\n\n\n\n\n\nList-columns: nest() and unnest()\nWe now look into list-columns, which are columns in which each element is composed of a list. When we think of a vector, most of the time we see a single value that is stored in an element. A list-column changes this. That value is now a list, which can be of any length we desire.\nList-columns can be expanded by unnest(). This has the effect of lengthening the data frame (sort of like an accordion). Each row is duplicated for each unique value of each entry in the list-column.\nThe nest() function performs the opposite operation of “rolling up” the data frame to create a new list-column. We did this in the intro of list-columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ6\n\n\n\nNow using the starwars tibble, experiment with list-columns by expanding and contracting the other list-columns in the storms data frame.\n\n\n\n\nMapping over list columns\nSuppose now we want to add the numbers of films for each character to the starwars data set.

    "text": "Exercises\nFor these exercises, you will be working exclusively with the starwars tibble. Answer the following questions below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ1\n\n\n\nUsing a dplyr function, construct a tibble from starwars that only contains characters with blue eyes.\n\n# Do not alter code right above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ2\n\n\n\nUsing a dplyr function, construct a tibble from starwars that only contains characters with blue eyes and a height below 100 cm. Then, display only the names of these characters.\n\n# Do not alter code right above.\n\n\n\n\nBase R Subsetting vs. dplyr() functions\nIn many applications, you will find R users that subset through the [], [[]], $ symbols, but unless we know the type and functionality associated with the type, we will run across some errors.\nThe next few exercises will showcase this. You will use the following objects in the next 3 exercises.\n\nnum &lt;- 5\nvar &lt;- \"skin_color\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ3\n\n\n\nUsing starwars, access the 5th column using the num object within the [[]], [] and $ operators. What do you notice?\n\n# Do not alter code right above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ4\n\n\n\nUsing starwars, access the 5th column using the var object within the [[]], [] and $ operators. What do you notice?\n\n# Do not alter code right above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ5\n\n\n\nUsing starwars, access the 5th column by name with one of the dplyr functions. What do you notice?\n\n# Do not alter code right above.\n\n\n\n\n\nList-columns: nest() and unnest()\nWe now look into list-columns, which are columns in which each element is composed of a list. When we think of a vector, most of the time we see a single value that is stored in an element. A list-column changes this. That value is now a list, which can be of any length we desire.\nList-columns can be expanded by unnest(). This has the effect of lengthening the data frame (sort of like an accordion). Each row is duplicated for each unique value of each entry in the list-column.\nThe nest() function performs the opposite operation of “rolling up” the data frame to create a new list-column. We did this in the intro of list-columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ6\n\n\n\nNow using the starwars tibble, experiment with list-columns by expanding and contracting the other list-columns in the storms data frame.\n\n\n\n\nMapping over list columns\nSuppose now we want to add the numbers of films for each character to the starwars data set. A simple mutate() like this will not throw an error, but also won’t do what we want.\n\noops &lt;- starwars |&gt;\n  mutate(num_films = length(films)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(num_films)) |&gt;\n  select(name, num_films)\noops\n\n# A tibble: 87 × 2\n   name               num_films\n   &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Luke Skywalker            87\n 2 C-3PO                     87\n 3 R2-D2                     87\n 4 Darth Vader               87\n 5 Leia Organa               87\n 6 Owen Lars                 87\n 7 Beru Whitesun Lars        87\n 8 R5-D4                     87\n 9 Biggs Darklighter         87\n10 Obi-Wan Kenobi            87\n# ℹ 77 more rows\n\n\nThis just made all of the entries equal to length(films).\n\nall(oops$num_films == length(starwars$films))\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nTo get this right, we need to map() inside our mutate().\n\nstarwars |&gt;\n  mutate(num_films_actual = map_int(films, length)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(num_films_actual)) |&gt;\n  select(name, num_films_actual, films)\n\n# A tibble: 87 × 3\n   name           num_films_actual films    \n   &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;int&gt; &lt;list&gt;   \n 1 R2-D2                         7 &lt;chr [7]&gt;\n 2 C-3PO                         6 &lt;chr [6]&gt;\n 3 Obi-Wan Kenobi                6 &lt;chr [6]&gt;\n 4 Luke Skywalker                5 &lt;chr [5]&gt;\n 5 Leia Organa                   5 &lt;chr [5]&gt;\n 6 Chewbacca                     5 &lt;chr [5]&gt;\n 7 Yoda                          5 &lt;chr [5]&gt;\n 8 Palpatine                     5 &lt;chr [5]&gt;\n 9 Darth Vader                   4 &lt;chr [4]&gt;\n10 Han Solo                      4 &lt;chr [4]&gt;\n# ℹ 77 more rows"

If it is not empty, use the broom icon in the Environment tab in RStudio to empty it.\n\n\nBefore we do anything, how much memory is being used by our R session?\n\nmem_used()\n\n85.34 MB\n\n\nRecall that a byte is eight bits. A byte is a very small amount of information, typically used to store one character. A kilobyte is 1000 bytes, and a megabyte is 1000 kilobytes, etc. You should familiarize yourself briefly with the orders of magnitude of data.\nNow suppose we add some things to our workspace. We can add objects, functions, or load packages. Does loading a package increase the memory used by our session?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ2:\n\n\n\nUse the library() command to load the broom package. Then check the memory usage with mem_used(). Does loading a package increase the amount of memory used? By how much?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ3:\n\n\n\nWhat about loading a data set? Use the data() command to load the iris data set. Does that increase the memory usage? By how much?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ4:\n\n\n\nUse obj_size() to measure the amount of memory that iris takes up. Was the increase you observed previously equal to this amount?\n\n\n\n\nMaking Copies\nAs much fun as it is to make copies, each copy occupies memory. Generally, we want to minimize the amount of memory that our code needs to run.\nLet’s store the amount of memory we are currently using.\n\nbefore &lt;- mem_used()\n\nNote the memory location of the iris data frame.\n\nref(iris)\n\n█ [1:0x212ac05e468] &lt;df[,5]&gt; \n├─Sepal.Length = [2:0x212a27ea260] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Sepal.Width = [3:0x212a27e9360] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Petal.Length = [4:0x212a27ea760] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Petal.Width = [5:0x212a27e8460] &lt;dbl&gt; \n└─Species = [6:0x212a08da7f0] &lt;fct&gt; \n\n\nNote that we can bind a second name my_iris to the iris data frame, without making a copy.\n\nmy_iris &lt;- iris\nref(my_iris)\n\n█ [1:0x212ac05e468] &lt;df[,5]&gt; \n├─Sepal.Length = [2:0x212a27ea260] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Sepal.Width = [3:0x212a27e9360] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Petal.Length = [4:0x212a27ea760] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Petal.Width = [5:0x212a27e8460] &lt;dbl&gt; \n└─Species = [6:0x212a08da7f0] &lt;fct&gt; \n\n\nNow let’s change the data frame in a way that forces a copy to be made.\n\nmy_iris &lt;- my_iris |&gt;\n  mutate(sepal_area = Sepal.Length * Sepal.Width)\nref(my_iris)\n\n█ [1:0x212a94adc68] &lt;df[,6]&gt; \n├─Sepal.Length = [2:0x212a27ea260] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Sepal.Width = [3:0x212a27e9360] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Petal.Length = [4:0x212a27ea760] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Petal.Width = [5:0x212a27e8460] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Species = [6:0x212a08da7f0] &lt;fct&gt; \n└─sepal_area = [7:0x212a27ecf60] &lt;dbl&gt; \n\n\nNote that the memory locations of my_iris and iris are not the same anymore. However, the memory locations of the underlying vectors are the same!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ5:\n\n\n\nUse before and mem_used() to calculate how much extra memory the copy of my_iris occupies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ6:\n\n\n\nIs the difference you observed above equal to the size of the new column we created? Why or why not?\n\n\nDifferent representations of the same data may have different memory footprints. Suppose we change the iris data set into its long format.\n\niris_long &lt;- iris |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(-Species, names_to = \"type\", values_to = \"measurement\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ7:\n\n\n\nDoes iris_long take up the same amount of memory as iris? Why or why not?\n\n\nWe know that tibbles are like data.frames. Do they take up the same amount of memory?\n\nbefore &lt;- mem_used()\niris_tbl &lt;- iris_long |&gt;\n  as_tibble()\nmem_used() - before\n\n-6.07 kB\n\nclass(iris_tbl)\n\n[1] \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\n\nDoes converting a data.frame to a tbl force a copy?\n\nref(iris_tbl)\n\n█ [1:0x212a6144918] &lt;tibble[,3]&gt; \n├─Species = [2:0x212a00ed450] &lt;fct&gt; \n├─type = [3:0x212a01ddf50] &lt;chr&gt; \n└─measurement = [4:0x212a01d4750] &lt;dbl&gt; \n\nref(iris_long)\n\n█ [1:0x212a925c968] &lt;tibble[,3]&gt; \n├─Species = [2:0x212a00ed450] &lt;fct&gt; \n├─type = [3:0x212a01ddf50] &lt;chr&gt; \n└─measurement = [4:0x212a01d4750] &lt;dbl&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ8:\n\n\n\nDiscuss how using a tibble changes the memory footprint relative to using a data.frame.\n\n\n\n\nTracing memory\nUnfortunately, due to various complications and optimizations, it’s not always possible to reason ahead of time about whether R will make a copy of an object. Instead, we can use the tracemem() function to have R tell us whether it makes a copy and why.\nFirst, note the memory location of iris.\n\ntracemem(iris)\n\n[1] \"&lt;00000212AC05E468&gt;\"\n\n\nWe are now tracing this memory location. Some types of computations we make on iris do not require making a copy.\n\niris |&gt;\n  pull(Petal.Length) |&gt;\n  mean()\n\n[1] 3.758\n\n\nHowever, if we modify iris using mutate(), a copy does get made.\n\niris |&gt;\n  mutate(petal_area = Petal.Length * Petal.Width) |&gt;\n  as_tibble()\n\ntracemem[0x00000212ac05e468 -&gt; 0x000002129fcbf808]: initialize &lt;Anonymous&gt; mutate_cols mutate.data.frame mutate as_tibble eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers eval eval with_handlers doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList withRestarts &lt;Anonymous&gt; evaluate in_dir in_input_dir eng_r block_exec call_block process_group withCallingHandlers with_options &lt;Anonymous&gt; process_file &lt;Anonymous&gt; &lt;Anonymous&gt; execute .main \ntracemem[0x000002129fcbf808 -&gt; 0x000002129e834c38]: dplyr_new_list initialize &lt;Anonymous&gt; mutate_cols mutate.data.frame mutate as_tibble eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers eval eval with_handlers doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList withRestarts &lt;Anonymous&gt; evaluate in_dir in_input_dir eng_r block_exec call_block process_group withCallingHandlers with_options &lt;Anonymous&gt; process_file &lt;Anonymous&gt; &lt;Anonymous&gt; execute .main \ntracemem[0x000002129e834c38 -&gt; 0x000002129e348aa8]: dplyr_new_list initialize &lt;Anonymous&gt; mutate_cols mutate.data.frame mutate as_tibble eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers eval eval with_handlers doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList withRestarts &lt;Anonymous&gt; evaluate in_dir in_input_dir eng_r block_exec call_block process_group withCallingHandlers with_options &lt;Anonymous&gt; process_file &lt;Anonymous&gt; &lt;Anonymous&gt; execute .main \ntracemem[0x00000212ac05e468 -&gt; 0x000002129df7c418]: new_data_frame vec_data as.list dplyr_col_modify.data.frame dplyr_col_modify mutate.data.frame mutate as_tibble eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers eval eval with_handlers doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList withRestarts &lt;Anonymous&gt; evaluate in_dir in_input_dir eng_r block_exec call_block process_group withCallingHandlers with_options &lt;Anonymous&gt; process_file &lt;Anonymous&gt; &lt;Anonymous&gt; execute .main \ntracemem[0x000002129df7c418 -&gt; 0x000002129df7c808]: as.list.data.frame as.list dplyr_col_modify.data.frame dplyr_col_modify mutate.data.frame mutate as_tibble eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers eval eval with_handlers doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList withRestarts &lt;Anonymous&gt; evaluate in_dir in_input_dir eng_r block_exec call_block process_group withCallingHandlers with_options &lt;Anonymous&gt; process_file &lt;Anonymous&gt; &lt;Anonymous&gt; execute .main \n\n\n# A tibble: 150 × 6\n   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species petal_area\n          &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2 setosa        0.28\n 2          4.9         3            1.4         0.2 setosa        0.28\n 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2 setosa        0.26\n 4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2 setosa        0.3 \n 5          5           3.6          1.4         0.2 setosa        0.28\n 6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4 setosa        0.68\n 7          4.6         3.4          1.4         0.3 setosa        0.42\n 8          5           3.4          1.5         0.2 setosa        0.3 \n 9          4.4         2.9          1.4         0.2 setosa        0.28\n10          4.9         3.1          1.5         0.1 setosa        0.15\n# ℹ 140 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ9:\n\n\n\nExperiment with different operations after invoking tracemem().

Also load the tidyverse package.\n\nlibrary(lobstr)\n\nWarning: package 'lobstr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'lubridate' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.6.0\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.2.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nYour workspace should be empty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ1:\n\n\n\nUse ls() to list the objects in your workspace. If it is not empty, use the broom icon in the Environment tab in RStudio to empty it.\n\n# PUT SOLUTION HERE\n\n\n\nBefore we do anything, how much memory is being used by our R session?\n\nmem_used()\n\n85.34 MB\n\n\nRecall that a byte is eight bits. A byte is a very small amount of information, typically used to store one character. A kilobyte is 1000 bytes, and a megabyte is 1000 kilobytes, etc. You should familiarize yourself briefly with the orders of magnitude of data.\nNow suppose we add some things to our workspace. We can add objects, functions, or load packages. Does loading a package increase the memory used by our session?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ2:\n\n\n\nUse the library() command to load the broom package. Then check the memory usage with mem_used(). Does loading a package increase the amount of memory used? By how much?\n\n# PUT SOLUTION HERE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ3:\n\n\n\nWhat about loading a data set? Use the data() command to load the iris data set. Does that increase the memory usage? By how much?\n\n# PUT SOLUTION HERE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ4:\n\n\n\nUse obj_size() to measure the amount of memory that iris takes up. Was the increase you observed previously equal to this amount?\n\n# PUT SOLUTION HERE\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Copies\nAs much fun as it is to make copies, each copy occupies memory. Generally, we want to minimize the amount of memory that our code needs to run.\nLet’s store the amount of memory we are currently using.\n\nbefore &lt;- mem_used()\n\nNote the memory location of the iris data frame.\n\nref(iris)\n\n█ [1:0x24bb2e1f3f8] &lt;df[,5]&gt; \n├─Sepal.Length = [2:0x24ba95e8860] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Sepal.Width = [3:0x24ba95e6f60] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Petal.Length = [4:0x24ba95e7460] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Petal.Width = [5:0x24ba95e9260] &lt;dbl&gt; \n└─Species = [6:0x24ba76e1610] &lt;fct&gt; \n\n\nNote that we can bind a second name my_iris to the iris data frame, without making a copy.\n\nmy_iris &lt;- iris\nref(my_iris)\n\n█ [1:0x24bb2e1f3f8] &lt;df[,5]&gt; \n├─Sepal.Length = [2:0x24ba95e8860] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Sepal.Width = [3:0x24ba95e6f60] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Petal.Length = [4:0x24ba95e7460] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Petal.Width = [5:0x24ba95e9260] &lt;dbl&gt; \n└─Species = [6:0x24ba76e1610] &lt;fct&gt; \n\n\nNow let’s change the data frame in a way that forces a copy to be made.\n\nmy_iris &lt;- my_iris |&gt;\n  mutate(sepal_area = Sepal.Length * Sepal.Width)\nref(my_iris)\n\n█ [1:0x24bb0048cd8] &lt;df[,6]&gt; \n├─Sepal.Length = [2:0x24ba95e8860] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Sepal.Width = [3:0x24ba95e6f60] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Petal.Length = [4:0x24ba95e7460] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Petal.Width = [5:0x24ba95e9260] &lt;dbl&gt; \n├─Species = [6:0x24ba76e1610] &lt;fct&gt; \n└─sepal_area = [7:0x24ba95eb560] &lt;dbl&gt; \n\n\nNote that the memory locations of my_iris and iris are not the same anymore. However, the memory locations of the underlying vectors are the same!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ5:\n\n\n\nUse before and mem_used() to calculate how much extra memory the copy of my_iris occupies.\n\n# PUT SOLUTION HERE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ6:\n\n\n\nIs the difference you observed above equal to the size of the new column we created? Why or why not?\n\n# PUT SOLUTION HERE\n\n\n\nDifferent representations of the same data may have different memory footprints. Suppose we change the iris data set into its long format.\n\niris_long &lt;- iris |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(-Species, names_to = \"type\", values_to = \"measurement\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ7:\n\n\n\nDoes iris_long take up the same amount of memory as iris? Why or why not?\n\n# PUT SOLUTION HERE\n\n\n\nWe know that tibbles are like data.frames. Do they take up the same amount of memory?\n\nbefore &lt;- mem_used()\niris_tbl &lt;- iris_long |&gt;\n  as_tibble()\nmem_used() - before\n\n-6.70 kB\n\nclass(iris_tbl)\n\n[1] \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\n\nDoes converting a data.frame to a tbl force a copy?\n\nref(iris_tbl)\n\n█ [1:0x24baef8daa8] &lt;tibble[,3]&gt; \n├─Species = [2:0x24ba70e6250] &lt;fct&gt; \n├─type = [3:0x24ba6dddf50] &lt;chr&gt; \n└─measurement = [4:0x24ba6dd6d50] &lt;dbl&gt; \n\nref(iris_long)\n\n█ [1:0x24bafe18d38] &lt;tibble[,3]&gt; \n├─Species = [2:0x24ba70e6250] &lt;fct&gt; \n├─type = [3:0x24ba6dddf50] &lt;chr&gt; \n└─measurement = [4:0x24ba6dd6d50] &lt;dbl&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ8:\n\n\n\nDiscuss how using a tibble changes the memory footprint relative to using a data.frame.\nPUT SOLUTION HERE\n\n\n\n\nTracing memory\nUnfortunately, due to various complications and optimizations, it’s not always possible to reason ahead of time about whether R will make a copy of an object. Instead, we can use the tracemem() function to have R tell us whether it makes a copy and why.\nFirst, note the memory location of iris.\n\ntracemem(iris)\n\n[1] \"&lt;0000024BB2E1F3F8&gt;\"\n\n\nWe are now tracing this memory location. Some types of computations we make on iris do not require making a copy.\n\niris |&gt;\n  pull(Petal.Length) |&gt;\n  mean()\n\n[1] 3.758\n\n\nHowever, if we modify iris using mutate(), a copy does get made.\n\niris |&gt;\n  mutate(petal_area = Petal.Length * Petal.Width) |&gt;\n  as_tibble()\n\ntracemem[0x0000024bb2e1f3f8 -&gt; 0x0000024bac137708]: initialize &lt;Anonymous&gt; mutate_cols mutate.data.frame mutate as_tibble eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers eval eval with_handlers doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList withRestarts &lt;Anonymous&gt; evaluate in_dir in_input_dir eng_r block_exec call_block process_group withCallingHandlers with_options &lt;Anonymous&gt; process_file &lt;Anonymous&gt; &lt;Anonymous&gt; execute .main \ntracemem[0x0000024bac137708 -&gt; 0x0000024bac1378c8]: dplyr_new_list initialize &lt;Anonymous&gt; mutate_cols mutate.data.frame mutate as_tibble eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers eval eval with_handlers doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList withRestarts &lt;Anonymous&gt; evaluate in_dir in_input_dir eng_r block_exec call_block process_group withCallingHandlers with_options &lt;Anonymous&gt; process_file &lt;Anonymous&gt; &lt;Anonymous&gt; execute .main \ntracemem[0x0000024bac1378c8 -&gt; 0x0000024bac132978]: dplyr_new_list initialize &lt;Anonymous&gt; mutate_cols mutate.data.frame mutate as_tibble eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers eval eval with_handlers doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList withRestarts &lt;Anonymous&gt; evaluate in_dir in_input_dir eng_r block_exec call_block process_group withCallingHandlers with_options &lt;Anonymous&gt; process_file &lt;Anonymous&gt; &lt;Anonymous&gt; execute .main \ntracemem[0x0000024bb2e1f3f8 -&gt; 0x0000024ba7a868b8]: new_data_frame vec_data as.list dplyr_col_modify.data.frame dplyr_col_modify mutate.data.frame mutate as_tibble eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers eval eval with_handlers doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList withRestarts &lt;Anonymous&gt; evaluate in_dir in_input_dir eng_r block_exec call_block process_group withCallingHandlers with_options &lt;Anonymous&gt; process_file &lt;Anonymous&gt; &lt;Anonymous&gt; execute .main \ntracemem[0x0000024ba7a868b8 -&gt; 0x0000024ba7a86998]: as.list.data.frame as.list dplyr_col_modify.data.frame dplyr_col_modify mutate.data.frame mutate as_tibble eval eval withVisible withCallingHandlers eval eval with_handlers doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList doWithOneRestart withOneRestart withRestartList withRestarts &lt;Anonymous&gt; evaluate in_dir in_input_dir eng_r block_exec call_block process_group withCallingHandlers with_options &lt;Anonymous&gt; process_file &lt;Anonymous&gt; &lt;Anonymous&gt; execute .main \n\n\n# A tibble: 150 × 6\n   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species petal_area\n          &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2 setosa        0.28\n 2          4.9         3            1.4         0.2 setosa        0.28\n 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2 setosa        0.26\n 4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2 setosa        0.3 \n 5          5           3.6          1.4         0.2 setosa        0.28\n 6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4 setosa        0.68\n 7          4.6         3.4          1.4         0.3 setosa        0.42\n 8          5           3.4          1.5         0.2 setosa        0.3 \n 9          4.4         2.9          1.4         0.2 setosa        0.28\n10          4.9         3.1          1.5         0.1 setosa        0.15\n# ℹ 140 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ9:\n\n\n\nExperiment with different operations after invoking tracemem().

    "text": "Scoping\nR uses lexical scoping. This means that when R looks for the value of names, it depends on the state of things when the function is defined.\n\nName Masking\nR looks for variables inside a function definition first (local variables), but if it can’t find them, it looks in the parent environment. In this case, when my_fun() is executed, R looks for the value of global_var. Many programming languages will throw an error in this situation, because global_var is not defined in the environment created by my_fun(). However, R just keeps looking for global_var in the parent environment (which in this case is the global environment).\n\nglobal_var &lt;- 21\n\nmy_fun &lt;- function(x) {\n  x + global_var\n}\n\nmy_fun(3)\n\n[1] 24\n\n\n\nenvironment(my_fun)\n\n&lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt;\n\n\nNote also that if we try to re-define global_var inside the function definition, we are masking the name global_var.\n\nmy_fun2 &lt;- function(x) {\n  global_var &lt;- 99\n  x + global_var\n}\n\nmy_fun2(3)\n\n[1] 102\n\n\nNote the difference reported by findGlobals().\n\ncodetools::findGlobals(my_fun)\n\n[1] \"{\"          \"+\"          \"global_var\"\n\n\n\ncodetools::findGlobals(my_fun2)\n\n[1] \"{\"  \"+\"  \"&lt;-\"\n\n\n\n\nA Fresh Start\nLocal variables that are created inside a function never see the light of day in the parent environment.\n\nmy_fun3 &lt;- function(x) {\n  local_var &lt;- 7\n  x + global_var\n}\n\nmy_fun3(3)\n\n[1] 24\n\n\n\nlocal_var\n\nError:\n! object 'local_var' not found\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ4\n\n\n\nWhy would it be a bad idea to allow the value of local variables to persist outside of the function?\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Lookup\nBecause of name masking, values of objects in the parent environment can affect the behavior of a function.

    "section": "The Dots",
    "text": "The Dots\nThe dots (...) are a way of collecting an arbitrary set of arguments to a function. There are two main purposes as to why you might want to have the dots as an arguments to your function.\nFirst, note that you can convert the dots into a named list within your function using the list() function.\n\ncatch_the_dots &lt;- function(...) {\n  list(...)\n}\n\ncatch_the_dots(whatever = \"hi\")\n\n$whatever\n[1] \"hi\"\n\n\n\nPassing the Dots\nYou might want to pass the dots to another function from within your function. This is typically useful when you want to leverage the functionality of an existing function, without having to specify all of its arguments. For example, suppose we want to add theming to a ggplot. One way to do that would be to extend the scale_color_manual() function and hard-code the official Smith colors.\nFirst, note that scale_color_manual() takes the dots as an argument.\n\nargs(ggplot2::scale_color_manual)\n\nfunction (..., values, aesthetics = \"colour\", breaks = waiver(), \n    na.value = \"grey50\") \nNULL\n\n\nMoreover, it passes the dots to manual_scale():\n\nbody(ggplot2::scale_color_manual)\n\n{\n    manual_scale(aesthetics, values, breaks, ..., na.value = na.value)\n}\n\n\nWhich in turn passes the dots to discrete_scale():\n\nbody(ggplot2:::manual_scale)\n\n{\n    call &lt;- call %||% current_call()\n    if (is_missing(values)) {\n        values &lt;- NULL\n    }\n    else {\n        force(values)\n    }\n    if (is.null(limits) && !is.null(names(values))) {\n        force(aesthetic)\n        limits &lt;- function(x) {\n            x &lt;- intersect(x, c(names(values), NA)) %||% character()\n            if (length(x) &lt; 1) {\n                cli::cli_warn(paste0(\"No shared levels found between {.code names(values)} of the manual \", \n                  \"scale and the data's {.field {aesthetic}} values.\"))\n            }\n            x\n        }\n    }\n    if (is.vector(values) && is.null(names(values)) && !is_waiver(breaks) && \n        !is.null(breaks) && !is.function(breaks)) {\n        if (length(breaks) &lt;= length(values)) {\n            names(values) &lt;- breaks\n        }\n        else {\n            names(values) &lt;- breaks[seq_along(values)]\n        }\n    }\n    pal &lt;- function(n) {\n        if (n &gt; length(values)) {\n            cli::cli_abort(\"Insufficient values in manual scale. {n} needed but only {length(values)} provided.\")\n        }\n        values\n    }\n    discrete_scale(aesthetic, name = name, palette = pal, breaks = breaks, \n        limits = limits, call = call, ...)\n}\n\n\nWhich actually does the work (Note that having 3 colons ::: allows you to access functions in an R package that aren’t @exported, i.e. are kept hidden from the user in the function’s roxygen2 code).\n\nbody(ggplot2::discrete_scale)\n\n{\n    call &lt;- call %||% current_call()\n    if (lifecycle::is_present(scale_name)) {\n        deprecate_soft0(\"3.5.0\", \"discrete_scale(scale_name)\")\n    }\n    aesthetics &lt;- standardise_aes_names(aesthetics)\n    check_breaks_labels(breaks, labels, call = call)\n    fallback.palette &lt;- validate_fallback_palette(palette, fallback.palette, \n        aesthetics, discrete = TRUE, call = call)\n    limits &lt;- allow_lambda(limits)\n    breaks &lt;- allow_lambda(breaks)\n    labels &lt;- allow_lambda(labels)\n    minor_breaks &lt;- allow_lambda(minor_breaks)\n    if (!is.function(limits) && (length(limits) &gt; 0) && !is_discrete(limits)) {\n        cli::cli_warn(c(\"Continuous limits supplied to discrete scale.\", \n            i = \"Did you mean {.code limits = factor(...)} or {.fn scale_*_continuous}?\"), \n            call = call)\n    }\n    position &lt;- arg_match0(position, c(\"left\", \"right\", \"top\", \n        \"bottom\"))\n    is_position &lt;- any(is_position_aes(aesthetics))\n    if (is.null(breaks) && !is_position) {\n        guide &lt;- \"none\"\n    }\n    if (is_position && identical(palette, identity)) {\n        palette &lt;- seq_len\n    }\n    ggproto(NULL, super, call = call, aesthetics = aesthetics, \n        palette = palette, fallback_palette = fallback.palette, \n        range = DiscreteRange$new(), limits = limits, na.value = na.value, \n        na.translate = na.translate, expand = expand, name = name, \n        breaks = breaks, minor_breaks = minor_breaks, labels = labels, \n        drop = drop, guide = guide, position = position)\n}\n\n\nAccording to the Smith College Visual Identity program, the official Smith colors are: #002855, #F2A900.\nThus, we can create a scale_color_smith() function that leverages scale_color_manual() by hard-coding the official Smith color values. But in order to get this to work, we have to pass the dots so that scale_color_manual() can do all the work that it normally does! Otherwise, we would have to copy the source of scale_color_manual() – but that would be inefficient and brittle.\n\nscale_color_smith &lt;- function(...) {\n  ggplot2::scale_color_manual(\n    ..., \n    values = c(\"#002855\", \"#F2A900\")\n  )\n}\n\nWe can then use our custom function. Note that since it only has two colors, it won’t work if it is mapped to a categorical variable with more than two levels.\n\nstarwars |&gt;\n  filter(species %in% c(\"Human\", \"Droid\")) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass, color = species)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  scale_color_smith()\n\nWarning: Removed 17 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ7\n\n\n\nWrite the corresponding function scale_fill_smith() and test it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantQ8\n\n\n\nWrite a scale_color_gradient_smith() function that produces a gradient scale from Smith blue to Smith gold."

    "text": "The Dots\nThe dots (...) are a way of collecting an arbitrary set of arguments to a function. There are two main purposes as to why you might want to have the dots as an arguments to your function.\nFirst, note that you can convert the dots into a named list within your function using the list() function.\n\ncatch_the_dots &lt;- function(...) {\n  list(...)\n}\n\ncatch_the_dots(whatever = \"hi\")\n\n$whatever\n[1] \"hi\"\n\n\n\nPassing the Dots\nYou might want to pass the dots to another function from within your function. This is typically useful when you want to leverage the functionality of an existing function, without having to specify all of its arguments. For example, suppose we want to add theming to a ggplot. One way to do that would be to extend the scale_color_manual() function and hard-code the official Smith colors.\nFirst, note that scale_color_manual() takes the dots as an argument.\n\nargs(ggplot2::scale_color_manual)\n\nfunction (..., values, aesthetics = \"colour\", breaks = waiver(), \n    na.value = \"grey50\") \nNULL\n\n\nMoreover, it passes the dots to manual_scale():\n\nbody(ggplot2::scale_color_manual)\n\n{\n    manual_scale(aesthetics, values, breaks, ..., na.value = na.value)\n}\n\n\nWhich in turn passes the dots to discrete_scale():\n\nbody(ggplot2:::manual_scale)\n\n{\n    call &lt;- call %||% current_call()\n    if (is_missing(values)) {\n        values &lt;- NULL\n    }\n    else {\n        force(values)\n    }\n    if (is.null(limits) && !is.null(names(values))) {\n        force(aesthetic)\n        limits &lt;- function(x) {\n            x &lt;- intersect(x, c(names(values), NA)) %||% character()\n            if (length(x) &lt; 1) {\n                cli::cli_warn(paste0(\"No shared levels found between {.code names(values)} of the manual \", \n                  \"scale and the data's {.field {aesthetic}} values.\"))\n            }\n            x\n        }\n    }\n    if (is.vector(values) && is.null(names(values)) && !is_waiver(breaks) && \n        !is.null(breaks) && !is.function(breaks)) {\n        if (length(breaks) &lt;= length(values)) {\n            names(values) &lt;- breaks\n        }\n        else {\n            names(values) &lt;- breaks[seq_along(values)]\n        }\n    }\n    pal &lt;- function(n) {\n        if (n &gt; length(values)) {\n            cli::cli_abort(\"Insufficient values in manual scale. {n} needed but only {length(values)} provided.\")\n        }\n        values\n    }\n    discrete_scale(aesthetic, name = name, palette = pal, breaks = breaks, \n        limits = limits, call = call, ...)\n}\n\n\nWhich actually does the work (Note that having 3 colons ::: allows you to access functions in an R package that aren’t @exported, i.e. are kept hidden from the user in the function’s roxygen2 code).\n\nbody(ggplot2::discrete_scale)\n\n{\n    call &lt;- call %||% current_call()\n    if (lifecycle::is_present(scale_name)) {\n        deprecate_soft0(\"3.5.0\", \"discrete_scale(scale_name)\")\n    }\n    aesthetics &lt;- standardise_aes_names(aesthetics)\n    check_breaks_labels(breaks, labels, call = call)\n    fallback.palette &lt;- validate_fallback_palette(palette, fallback.palette, \n        aesthetics, discrete = TRUE, call = call)\n    limits &lt;- allow_lambda(limits)\n    breaks &lt;- allow_lambda(breaks)\n    labels &lt;- allow_lambda(labels)\n    minor_breaks &lt;- allow_lambda(minor_breaks)\n    if (!is.function(limits) && (length(limits) &gt; 0) && !is_discrete(limits)) {\n        cli::cli_warn(c(\"Continuous limits supplied to discrete scale.\", \n            i = \"Did you mean {.code limits = factor(...)} or {.fn scale_*_continuous}?\"), \n            call = call)\n    }\n    position &lt;- arg_match0(position, c(\"left\", \"right\", \"top\", \n        \"bottom\"))\n    is_position &lt;- any(is_position_aes(aesthetics))\n    if (is.null(breaks) && !is_position) {\n        guide &lt;- \"none\"\n    }\n    if (is_position && identical(palette, identity)) {\n        palette &lt;- seq_len\n    }\n    ggproto(NULL, super, call = call, aesthetics = aesthetics, \n        palette = palette, fallback_palette = fallback.palette, \n        range = DiscreteRange$new(), limits = limits, na.value = na.value, \n        na.translate = na.translate, expand = expand, name = name, \n        breaks = breaks, minor_breaks = minor_breaks, labels = labels, \n        drop = drop, guide = guide, position = position)\n}\n\n\nAccording to the Smith College Visual Identity program, the official Smith colors are: #002855, #F2A900.\nThus, we can create a scale_color_smith() function that leverages scale_color_manual() by hard-coding the official Smith color values. But in order to get this to work, we have to pass the dots so that scale_color_manual() can do all the work that it normally does! Otherwise, we would have to copy the source of scale_color_manual() – but that would be inefficient and brittle.\n\nscale_color_smith &lt;- function(...) {\n  ggplot2::scale_color_manual(\n    ..., \n    values = c(\"#002855\", \"#F2A900\")\n  )\n}\n\nWe can then use our custom function.

We will create functions that run through two different types of games: one that involves a deck of cards and another that involves a spinning wheel.\nThis question involves using the sample() function in various ways.

Return winnings, which will be of a combination of these outcomes minus the wager:\n\nIf card is “red”, bettor wins three times their wager.\nIf card is a face card, bettor wins half their wager.\nIf card is “black” and a 10, bettor wins half their wager.\nAnything else results in no winnings.\n\nFor example, if a red jack is drawn, then the player wins 3.5x their wager back and we will return what they earned minus the wager they put in. As such, $10 wagered will return $25 in winnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant(b)\n\n\n\nCreate a function named wheel that takes in the following arguments:\n\nwager: amount of money wagered\n\nReturn winnings, which will be the net gain of the following spin probabilities:\n\n10% chance that they win five times their wager\n20% chance that they win their wager back\n70% chance that they win no money back\n\nFor example, if $10 is wagered and they win on the 5x spot, they will get a net $40 in return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant(c)\n\n\n\nCreate a function named game that passes arguments without addressing them to the card and wheel games within the function. Use a sample() function with an if-else chain to determine which type of game they play, with the following specifications:\n\n30% chance they play cards\n70% chance they play the wheel\n\nReturn their net gain after playing the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant(d)\n\n\n\nUse the replicate() function to play the game 1000 times, with a wager of $10 each time.
