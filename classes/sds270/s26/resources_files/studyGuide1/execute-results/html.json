This means you will be working with particular datasets, but will be writing in prose about how to work through a problem (e.g. psuedo-code, sentences) over code.\n\nThere will be four questions on the exam and you will have 75 minutes to complete the exam. This will be a closed-note exam, with no access to any resources whatever. Most questions will be centered around a particular dataset, with information regarding some characteristics and all variables. Please read this information before tackling the problems. \n\n## Background\n\nThe dataset we will focus our analysis on is a dataset regarding seven different dry beans and their characteristics over time. You can see a real synposis here:\n\n> Seven different types of dry beans were used in this research, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation. A computer vision system was developed to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features in order to obtain uniform seed classification. For the classification model, images of 13,611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera. Bean images obtained by computer vision system were subjected to segmentation and feature extraction stages, and a total of 16 features; 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains. [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset)\n\n`Area`:\tThe area of a bean zone and the number of pixels within its boundaries (double)\n`Perimeter`: Bean circumference is defined as the length of its border (double)\n`MajorAxisLength`: The distance between the ends of the longest line that can be drawn from a bean (double)\n`MinorAxisLength`: The longest line that can be drawn from the bean while standing perpendicular to the main axis\t(double)\n`AspectRatio`: Defines the relationship between MajorAxisLength and MinorAxisLength\t(double)\n`Eccentricity`: Eccentricity of the ellipse having the same moments as the region (double)\n`ConvexArea`: Number of pixels in the smallest convex polygon that can contain the area of a bean seed (integer)\n`EquivDiameter`: Equivalent diameter: The diameter of a circle having the same area as a bean seed area\t(double)\n`Extent`: The ratio of the pixels in the bounding box to the bean area (double)\n`Solidity`: Also known as convexity. The ratio of the pixels in the convex shell to those found in beans (double)\n`Roundness`: Calculated with the following formula: $\\frac{4 \\pi A}{P^2}$\t(double)\n`Compactness`: Measures the roundness of an object (units of Ed/L, double)\n`ShapeFactor1`: (double)\n`ShapeFactor2`: (double)\n`ShapeFactor3`: (double)\n`ShapeFactor4`: (double)\n`Class`: Seker, Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermosan, Horoz, and Sira\t(character)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Q1: Data Preparation (40 pts)\n\n(a) Highlight the main differences between atomic vector and list objects. \n\n(b) Let the `Area` and `Perimeter` be the first two columns in the dataset. Describe two ways we can access the areas and perimeters of all observations with an `Area` between 30,000 and 40,000 (inclusive).\n\n(c) Describe how memory is allocated for `data2` and `data3` when we run the following code at each of the checkpoints (labeled `#CP _`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n(d) Write pseudo-code/code that would print the summary of the `AspectRatio` for each group of the `Class` column in our `data` object.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n(e) Describe what would happen in the moment and with the `data` if we ran the following command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Q2: Sorting\n\n\n- Sort by MajorAxisLength, MinorAxisLength, put in two data frames\n\n- Keep most extreme cases\n\n- Create function to take in variable and data to print out top 3\n\n\n## Q3: Evaluating Changes in Script\n\n\n## Q4: Building A Whole Script\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) (5 pts) Provide the code/pseudocode with the appropriate symbols that would allow us to access the `Day_of_week` variable while retaining the `data.frame` type.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n(b) (5 pts) Provide the code/pseudocode with the appropriate symbols that would allow us to access the `Day_of_week` variable and its type.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n(c) (10 pts) Suppose we want to store the summary of each non-character variable in a pre-allocated list through the use of a for-loop. Critique the code below and spot areas in which problems may occur.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummaries <- vector(mode = \"list\", length = ncol(data))\nfor (i in c(1, ncol(data))){\n  summaries <- summary(data[i])\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n(d) (8 pts) Discuss how we can use a functional to perform the same task as seen in part (c). \n\n(e) (7 pts) The `summary()` function can take in a variety of arguments to be sent downstream to function calls nested within it depending on the object we are wanting a summary of. Address how we can handle these arguments if we were constructing the `summary()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Q3: Functions\n\n(a) (16 pts) Suppose we create code that defines new objects in R and creates a new function to run through a calculation:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nFor each sub-part (4 pts each), write what the output will be when running the following line in R:\n\n(i) `simpleCalc(x, y, z)`\n(ii) `simpleCalc(x = 7, y, z)`\n(iii) `x`\n(iv) `x + simpleCalc(x = 2, y = 1, z)`\n\n(b) (9 pts) Re-write the `simpleCalc` function in part (a) such that we're treating `x` and `y` as doubles of a length greater than 1. You do not need to account for the re-assignment of `x` to 3.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n(c) (10 pts) Suppose we remove the `simpleCalc()` function from our global environment. Describe the implications and consequences of this action with regard to memory allocation. \n\n## Q4: Building Code\n\nSketch out a script (of code/pseudocode and comments) that accomplishes the following:\n\n> I want to create an object in R that looks at every single day of the week (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, ..., Sunday) and houses the following: a five-number summary of the usage, a generic list of timestamps that indicate any outliers, and a frequency table of the types of loads during these days of the week. \n\nIn this sketch, specify what data/coding structures you will use and how they will accomplish the task. Consider appropriate ways to accomplish these tasks. \n  \n## Q5: Extra Credit (5 pts)\n\nDescribe a concept, small or large, that was not seen in this exam that you can elaborate on in 1-2 sentences.\n\n-->",
